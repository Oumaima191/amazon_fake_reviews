"Wireless Earbuds Bluetooth Headphones, Ear Buds with Touch Screen, ANC ENC Noise Cancelling Transparency Mode, 40H Stereo Deep Bass, IPX7 Waterproof, Clear Calls, 5 EQ for iOS Android (Black)",,4.8 out of 5 stars,491,These are by far the best earbuds that I've gotten to date. It has a built-in battery in the case like most. I can't tell you what the run time is on the earbuds but they'll run hours on a charge. I've never run out of battery so it is quite substantial on both the earbuds themselves and the case. The case ran down the battery after maybe I can't even say for sure maybe 50 hours or so. There is some protective plastic on the base of the buds don't forget to pull that off so that they can charge.  Where these things shine is the little extras. They sound amazing first and foremost. You wouldn't know that you didn't have a couple hundred dollar set of earbuds in. Those that I've had in the past would be very big earbuds almost to the point of ridiculous looking to get this kind of base and sound out of a very compact earbud. There are multiple EQ adjustment settings so you can find the one that works the best for you it's got the rock the pop the jazz etc. Volume control locking sliding touch screen on the case to play skip adjust volume and different levels of hearthrough and noise canceling. The noise canceling works fantastic. The hearthrough works great. And one of the most amazing things on this one that works on this unit and only this unit of the probably 20 different types of earbuds that I've tried in the past is that you can actually watch videos with it without the lag that will drive you insane and basically make you never watch a video. The lag is very very minimal to the point of almost being imperceptible. I really don't know what else you can want in a pair of earbuds these have it all and the value is unbeatable. Just buy them you'll love them. Oh and it has a battery level indicator for the buds that shows up and transfers to the case so you know how long you have left. It hardly moves at all. The only thing that's a little weird on this one that I found is it wouldn't recognize on the Bluetooth immediately so you take the buds out of the case put them in your ear and touch them for 5 seconds to turn them both on and then they can be recognized by your phone and you can sync up that way. That was the only weirdness that I found. These are top quality and I really can't think of a single way they can improve the buds themselves. Maybe make the case double tap to turn on the screen from the lock screen instead of having to open the top. But really that's just nitpicking. Well done thank you. Oh one more afterthought the base is banging on these things which is been thoroughly lacking on any other earbud in the size. That's what I meant about you had to have one that was five times bigger ridiculous looking that you couldn't really move around in or jog or run or bounce It All without them falling out. They figured out the bass problem in a compact unit. And they arrived the day after I order them without having to get the express shipping.Read more

"Sennheiser Consumer Audio Momentum 4 Wireless Headphones - Bluetooth Headset for Crystal-Clear Calls with Adaptive Noise Cancellation, 60h Battery Life, Customizable Sound, White (509267)",$265.95,4.0 out of 5 stars,"7,610","5 stars to me. 4 stars all around for the average consumer due to issues I believe others will find a problem with but I have found some workarounds forI will start off with the flaws (unfortunately it has em) from my experience and some solutions. They are mostly features based. I'll also address confusions and ""negative"" experiences as there are reviews where clearly it's the people and not the headphones that are the problem yet they are giving this a worse impression that it should have. And lastly praise what it has going well for itAlso, I will highly suggest downloading the new app version called smart control PLUS and install any firmware updates. Then go adjust settings or it will have some annoyances.FlawsOn-head detection: this causes most of the headaches. For those that like to free up an ear to listen to someone talk better - make a habit of freeing your left ear and not the right. There is a sensor to detect your ear and it is only INSIDE the right earcup.  It makes a double click noise when it detects and stops detecting your ear. Unfortunately it makes a similar sound for both which is a huge flaw as you might not know if it is detecting or not sometimes. This will trigger the auto off feature if it doesn't detect you while you're listening to music. It usually pauses from the headset, but there is a possibility it can be ignored by an app and continue playing so when you put it back on you might not even know if it detected you. Another possibility is you made the mistake of pressing play from the app itself when it stops detecting you thus eventually triggering the sleep feature. You can disable auto off but I personally put it in 1 hour just in case as I would have likely readjusted my headset by that point and reset it. This goes into the next feature: auto play. It's perfectly fine on mobile but on PC it can be a nightmare as you could be listening to music, you adjust your right earcup so it pauses and when you put it back on, it might play some other video like youtube in an open browser; it depends on the programs that behave to bluetooth pause/play. So don't have so many open video/audio programs in the background. Also for those with long hair, autoplay can struggle to detect if it completely covers your right ear (some people start to think it stopped working). Overall, I just disabled autoplay while keeping auto-off enabled as I mainly use the M4 on PC, but again, it seems to work really well on mobile. Plus of course if any of these aren't necessary to you, you can simply disable it as a whole for an old fashioned headphone experience to avoid annoyances but I have gotten used to it at this point that I rarely have issues [Update: I just learned on May 2025 that as of the new firmware 2.13.42 it reads ""Improved auto-off behavior reducing unexpected behavior during calls or streaming due to misdetection in smart pause sensor"", so perhaps this section might become untrue with less flaws down the road thus hopefully improving user experience]Multi- point connection: It can and will connect to two devices that have bluetooth active after they have been paired. There are individuals that pair their headphones to everything and might experience a random connection. Unfortunately no disabling this so you have to be precise with what you want to connect this with. I only paired this to PC and mobile so it doesn't attempt to connect to anything else but in the app you can click to what else in the list want to connect to (or delete). When it detects multiple signals it will prioritize connecting to what you last used, it seems. Not an issue for me. Also, it will ALWAYS prioritize audio for the first connection of the two which will usually be the phone. This is important. If it connects to my phone first, well lets say Im on the PC listening to music, once your phone makes any kind of sound, your audio will switch to it and interrupt the music, then resume playing your PC's music. Because of this, disable useless sounds like the lock screen opening sounds because that will trigger a switch (not sure about typing sounds). I have sound on for notifications to get my attention for the phone but if that is an annoyance I would try connecting other devices (like PC) as your main device first and then phone second. That way, it will ONLY play audio on the main device (PC) in spite of your phone making noises or playing audio. I tend to disable phone bluetooth, so it isn't an issue for me what connects first anyways. Now, this is a major flaw which may have been addressed in the new firmware update and app but I have not fully tested yet so this is based on months old experience. Last flaw with this. Do not have constant audio playing on -BOTH- devices because it will cause some static to what you are listening to. No idea why this happens but sometimes the music sounds glitchy and I realize it's because my PC is playing music alongside my phone. All it takes is not having something like music playing on the second device and it gets clean.Reboot: it can be done on the power button after holding for over 15 seconds. Be careful NOT to do this if it is not your intention. I have a friend who accidentally did thisHigh resolution: app is glitched if you try to do personalized sound after enabling high resolution. It will ask you to disable high resolution before proceeding. All you have to do is go to standard mode, make your sound profile, then go back and enable High Resolution.Confusions:ANC: some people complain you can't turn off ANC. You sort of can. Old app, on the ANC slide, you put the slider in the middle. Most importantly, the new version of the app now allows to turn off ANC and might possibly increase your battery life. Oh, and some people remark of ANC randomly activating when outside. That is the wind noise reduction activating during air blowing directly to your mics. You can turn it off in ANC settings (you can also adjust transparency during phone calls there) but trust me that you don't want to hear wind transmitted into a headsetAuto-answer calls: complaints on this but another reason you need the app to disable it if you don't want it.Aut-connect: some complain that if it moves it will auto connect or cause confusion when they don't know why their bluetooth loud speakers stopped working until they realize the headphones are connected. I personally love auto connect and has never been an issue. I put my headphones away where it won't move at all and once I grab it, boom, just straightforward and smooth connection grab and go. This is a feature of auto off so if you don't want it to be doing this you can either disable auto off (more like sleep) or turn off the headphones directly from the power button (which means you will also have to turn it back on with the button). I don't think of it as a flaw to be honestDiscord/meeting calls: This is a big one. There are people mentioning how when they get on discord, their music and game sounds muffled. That is its hands free activating because it believes you are in a call. It prioritizes the call once it is activating its mic. You may have noticed it on your phone before too with music getting muffled. Problem is these then get compared directly to a gaming headset. Most gaming headsets have a usb dongle. Those dongles are designed to give both high quality low latency audio and mic signals at the same time. These? They are bluetooth headsets not specifically designed for gaming but rather for high quality audio. This is not a major fault of the headset. There exists a workaround for this but you will have to disable handsfree and rely on a different mic (which can be a far superior option anyways). To do this - on windows 11, go to settings. Click ""bluetooth & devices"". Then click on ""view more devices"" up top to go to a drop down list of devices. Scroll all the way down until you find ""more devices and printer settings"". Find the M4 headset, right click and go to properties. Click on the hardware tab. On this list, look for Name ""Momentum 4 Hands-Free"" that is under Type ""Sound, Video..."". Click once on it then click on properties below. In properties, General tab, click on the blue and yellow shield that says Change Settings. Then go to the Driver tab and Click Disable Driver. Reboot PC. Can be undone in similar method. At this point it has no headset mic active ~specifically~ on the PC (phone should be unaffected) so audio will be clear but now an external mic will be needed.Experiences:Connectivity: people say they have connectivity issues but thankfully it is very rare for me. It has a good distance to it too. I keep up to date with everything on my phoneTouchpad: some say it is very sensitive. It is certainly more sensitive than usual but there are exaggerations to it. My hair does not trigger it. Turning my head does not trigger it. I don't trigger it with a hoodie on. I don't wear beanies over it (why would you?) so I cant say anything there. Stretching my arms above my head might trigger and laying my head on the right side might make it think you want to change volume or transparency. But some of these reviews are funny. They are not rated to be water resistant at all (like most headsets) so if rain drops trigger it, actually no, WHY DO YOU EVEN HAVE IT IN THE RAIN?App: the app is fine minus the glitch [refer to High Resolution in Flaws] and has only been improving bit by bit. There's now also a new version which requires a new download that will likely be getting more of a focus onDurability: it is plastic which makes it lighter but thankfully I have not broken anything. I have bumped it into things, dropped it once. I try to treat is as glass so these are rare occurrences. I would not work out in these due to the fact they are not designed to deal with liquid. If problems occur because you work out in these, well that's your fault, but there exist rubber sweat covers to put over the padding to help out a bit. The Sennheisers Momentum 4/Sport earbuds I believe have water resistance and might be worth a look instead if you need a true gym companionStrengthsAudio quality: right out of the box, they are great. It has a neutral sound profile while having some attention to bass. There are presets in the app that are decent and it really does not need a bass booster but it exists. To be honest, I would skip everything and go straight for the sound personalization feature in the app. It's very simple to adjust, uses mostly sliders while you listen to audio. And once you are done it will create a setting that somehow manages to be far superior than what's already available in the app. It just cleans up the sound so much more to your liking; the difference is bewildering. Ever since that point, I have not listened to music the same. Just when I thought I was getting bored of music, these revived that love to want to listen to everything again and also motivated me to listen to things I never did before. There is literally pre-Sennheiser and during-Sennheiser eras to me now and am curious to their wired headsets. One thing that will become super noticeable is its soundstage. It spreads the instruments to a degree where you can notice more of everything. Albeit, this can be discombobulating and bassheads might not like the lack of sharp precision but this isn't meant to be your average linear listening experience (the Accentum Plus offers this at a much lower price). To give an example: What is Life by George Harrison. I might prefer it on the more linear style I am used to but these can separate things to the point where it is also directional and you can feel like you are standing at a concert and George is directly in the middle of it all in front of you so it feels more real- similar to as if you are becoming conscious of your own breathing. And in midst of all the chaos, you can still clearly hear George's voice and you notice ALL of the instruments more. It first gave me goosebumps how much it changed the song. Some songs are designed to be ""linear"" which could possibly affect emotional type of songs negatively but from a musical perspective, my goodness it is incredible. Now I just go back to see what music I am used to that changes with these (hint: a lot). Electronic/hip-hop music perhaps is the exception but this gives such clarity to detail that it is still a great listen- one thing is for sure these headsets love when there is a band setup (Bjork, the Roots, Gorillaz, etc). Sound quality is the biggest reason you go for these.Comfort: I can go on for a while without my ears hurting or anything. Also these don't heat up much and has proper adjustability for bigger headsLook: I have the black with copper ring and they are absolutely gorgeous. I question the longevity of the cloth on the headstrap but it makes it more beautiful than it has any business being for a plastic headsetFeatures: ANC is better than I expected. It does its job, and though it might not lead in this category, the differences are so small compared to the competition. Also drowned out what I needed it to during plane trips. And hearthrough, although I have had better, they will more than suffice to the point where I rarely have any issues hearing people. The fact that it is good at both of these is amazing for value.Battery: they can go up to nearly 60 hours, especially in standard mode. Not an exaggeration. I can go days without charging them. For this quality of headset, I don't think much of the competition comes close to this. In fact this is the mind blowing part because most other bluetooth headsets don't sound anywhere as good as these and they have half the battery life if not worse. No fears when travelling that it will die on me. In fact, it lasted me an entire week's tripSurprisesGaming: it has low enough latency. Combine that with that very clean audio and surprising directional audio this already has and wow, it performs quite well. I can actually spot details better and sometimes extra details I wasn't aware like I remember distinctly many months ago when I played Paladins, not only was I able to hear behind a wall slightly above me, but I realized it was subtle high heel sounds. I am not saying this will replace top of the line gaming headsets like steel series but if you have these and not a gaming headset, these will more than suffice.Charging: I was already enamored by the battery life but the fact is, it handles charging nearly as well. You can get hours worth per 10 minutes of charging and around an hour and a half or so it will be fully charged. That may not sound great but half of that will net you 30 hours of life which is STILL more than the competition. And the other surprise was that I accidentally discovered on the PC that you can still use it while charging - it simply appears as a different sound output you have to switch to. I thought it was weird how multiple momentum 4's appeared but when I clicked the other output, music started booming through it again. I was shocked. It already has a super long battery life with quick charging. It doesn't need it yet it has it. I have never had a headset that allows that with USB-C. Sennheiser were practically showing off at this point. So I would get a super long cable to make this comfortable during charging if you think this is a feature you will be usingThese are already the greatest -bluetooth- headsets I have ever owned under the $500 mark. I have tried out direct competitors Airpods Max (best hearthrough and good clean quality) and Sony Xm5's (amazing features and stylish) but the M4 felt like a no brainer. The max have poor battery life (under 20 hours) meanwhile these can reach close to triple that. The XM5's are light and so smooth with their features and touchpad (I loved speak to chat) but their fragility comes into question as they are notorious for the hinges breaking no matter how good you take care of them while the M4's mostly have earpads wearing down (easily replaceable). Meanwhile, guess what? The M4's imo sound better than both of them, are more comfortable than both, and can be found MUCH cheaper than both as I have seen it as low as $190. Even if, say, the Bowers & Wilkins PX8 might have slightly better audio and a better build, it's not a major difference so it is imo horrifically overpriced while this just has much higher value after sales and is an easier recommendationOverall, it absolutely bothers me just how overrated the other headsets on Amazon usually are meanwhile these get a bad impression. If you are a fan of music and you want to improve that experience with the bluetooth format at great affordability, it doesn't get better than theseRead more"

I've had earbuds that made my head and brain feel like they were vibrating, I'm not a fan of that feeling really, so I love that these ones don't do that but have the great bass still. I love the fact that they have a button so that just a small tap won't pause or change anything when you don't want it to. even for phone calls, YouTube videos, and tiktok these are great! mine came in with a battery charge of 100% as well, so you should be able to use them right away. the purple pair that had gotten stolen had come in with a 97% charge, too. they do come with a charger but no USB block, which I don't feel like it's an issue. I'm sure we all have a block for that laying around or we could use a desktop or laptop to charge them. the color is very pretty, too! i was expecting more of a purple tone to it since I ordered purple blue this time, but they're more blue. still gorgeous! I'm definitely going to be ordering more, though. i want the light green ones, too! I love all the different color options! and they're all such pretty colors. the purple ones were so bright, I do miss those ones! but I adore these ones for sure! the little screens in the case have never never lagged for me, either. you'll see when the charge is decreasing and it does alert you when it's low immediately. the screen on the right does show what is pictured and will let you know if they're unevenly charged, which sometimes I only use one earbud, so that's great to know septhow much of a charge they have. they're definitely worth the price and I do recommend them! packaging is safe and secure for them as well! there is a film to pull off that protects the case when you unbox it as well. and they do come with a little bag of rubber ear pieces of different sizes, which is also awesome! i believe there's 2-3 different sized ones in the little bag. soooo 10/10 definitely recommend!Read more"

My Crushers literally hurt just to put them on and I have a tiny head! But THESE!!! They are such a joy to wear!!!-2 The Bluetooth connection just WORKS! I cannot understand how THESE headphones accomplish this when Apple and SC cannot!Apple pairs fine, but then randomly starts playing sound from another device all the time. Messing with settings is irritating and still it just starts playing audio from random iOS drives in the house! On the other hand, the Crushers have to be cleared in order to connect to a new device. Every time. I almost sent them back cause I assumed they were broke, but no. Apple struggles with it and you have to ‚Äúforget the device‚Äù every single time you want to say, go from your phone to an iPad (then back again). It‚Äôs madness. Some big brain thought this was a good idea.. These $20 ones; you power them on and BAM it connects and STAYS connected! If it doesn‚Äôt automatically connect, I just tap the name and it‚Äôs instant. ü§Ø-3 The mic is fantastic. I‚Äôve only used it in my home, but ppl tell me it‚Äôs crystal clear.-4 The easy eq on the side! No apps to download etc. just push it and it cycles through predetermined settings. And these settings actually make a diff. If you want to listen to an instrumental track, don‚Äôt leave it in ‚Äúbass‚Äù setting cause you will automatically think it‚Äôs the headphones and they are garbage. NO! Shame on you for blaming them lol-5 I‚Äôm not sure how to describe it as I‚Äôm not knowledgeable in audio devices (audiophile?), but what I also love about these is the spacial depth of sound. Some music just has the ability to surround you with these things in a way no other devices does. Even the AirPods with ‚Äúspacial audio‚Äù can‚Äôt seem to replicate these ‚Äúvast‚Äù atmospheric sounds at times. Of course this also relies heavily on the audio, but wow.-6 They fold so well. At first you might think, these things are flipping around everywhere and going to break.. nope. They just effortlessly fold in on themselves. I am rough on headphones too as a busy mom. They get tossed in my giant mom-backpack daily with no case or cover, squished between iPads etc and they are holding up like a champ!-7 I clean house in them for hours in the day and make/take calls as well. Not once have I received a low battery warning. They also have USB-C!!!!! For $20 I wouldn‚Äôt have expected that, and they charge incredibly fast.-8 The price. Omg the price lol I just spent more than $20 at McDonald‚Äôs.-9 They come packaged SO nice. It‚Äôs no iOS unboxing experience, but ordering anything online has me jaded lately. I fully expected these to just be in a plain box with some Chinese wording, with lots of bubble wrap, but no. It comes in a simple, well made, cardboard cube, but it has bright colors and a presentation value that‚Äôs hard to get online with cheap electronics.-10 the giant L/R on the inside! I never realized how many times I have flipped headphones and ear buds all around to figure out which was left ear and which was right. I never even knew I needed this in my life! It‚Äôs just another little detail that they didn‚Äôt HAVE to even bother with, but the details on these things seemed to matter to the designer and/or company.CONS:-1 They don‚Äôt get loud enough for me. Going from AirPods shooting sound waves into my ear canal and Crushers literally made to rattle from bass, directly to these can be frustrating as I have to just put them on max volume immediately. Is it a drastic volume issue? Absolutely not in my opinion. It‚Äôs just the ONE thing for me keeping these from being a god-tier S++++++ rating. Hell, this might even be considered a PRO feature, as I‚Äôm sure all my other devices are chipping away at my hearing one day at a time‚Ä¶-2 There IS no second con lol seriously.Conclusion:I have a white pair, bought my husband the black pair and am about to purchase my teen a pair. THAT is how much I love these and why I just HAD to write a literal essay about the brand.Read more"

The sound quality is way better than I expected‚Äîclear vocals, good treble, and surprisingly deep bass. Music actually sounds full and balanced, and I can hear a lot of detail. Whether I‚Äôm listening to music or taking calls, the audio is clear and strong.Battery life is a big win here. I get close to 9 hours on a single charge, and the case holds enough power to last for several more full charges‚Äîaround 48 hours total, which is more than enough for a few days without charging. The little LED display showing how much battery is left is a nice touch too.Comfort-wise, these are very lightweight and easy to wear. I‚Äôve used them while walking, working out, and even just doing stuff around the house. They stay in place and don‚Äôt bother my ears, even after wearing them for a long time. The included ear tips come in different sizes so it‚Äôs easy to find a good fit.Bluetooth connection is fast and stable. I just open the case and they connect right away. No dropouts or weird glitches. The touch controls work well once you get the hang of them‚Äîtakes a little practice to avoid hitting the wrong command, but nothing too frustrating.One more thing I really appreciate is the waterproofing. I‚Äôve used them during workouts and in light rain without any issues. It‚Äôs good peace of mind knowing they‚Äôre built to handle a bit of sweat or water.Overall, for the price, these earbuds are a great buy. Reliable, good sound, long battery life, and very easy to use. Definitely worth picking up if you want quality wireless earbuds without spending a fortune.Read more"
"Wireless Earbuds, Bluetooth Ear Buds Headphones with LED Charging Case, Deep Bass Stereo Sound, 40 Hours Playtime, IP7, Lightweight in-Ear Earphones for iPhone Android Sports Workout",$21.99,5.0 out of 5 stars,"3,501","OMG- Just opened the product and what I'm about to say is going to sound like a paid advertisement or fake staff review.  But, I gotta tell ya and assure you that my review is very real and honest and as a once skeptical customer with extremely low expectations.Well here it goes.  For starters, I hate earbuds in general.  I usually always buy and prefer FULL, BIG, OVER-THE-EAR HEADPHONES for the full noise cancellation benefits and secure, snug fit while walking, traveling, and working out.However, I saw a promo offer for these earbuds and decided to buy as a first timer while I continue to hunt down the perfect over-the-ear headphones.Let me tell you, I AM TRUELY SHOCKED and PLEASED.  I opened their small white pearlized plastic case and AS SOON as I removed one of the, the box lit up and showed a digital display of 100% (i.e. battery level).  They were/are so lightweight that I expected them to be cheap w/sub par sound (again, simply purchased as a backup and to hold me over until I purchased my ""real"" headphones.Well, I proceeded with the bluetooth set up on my laptop and never have I connected and activated a device so quickly!  As soon as I opened my add device list, it was on it already, so I clicked it and sound was INSTANTLY sent to the buds.  Wow!Not only was the sound crystal clear, but it was loud and had base like a MOVIE or HOME Theater. ( I know I'm beginning to sound like a paid employee or fake buyer, but I PROMISE I AM SPEAKING THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH!!!)  I mean the bass in the sound was literally too loud (which is a good thing). LOL.  I simply can't believe it.Then I felt bummed that it didn't have controls like my large headphones, but when I touched the outside of the buds, learned that the sleek design has ""touch"" controls that caused me to pause my video AND adjust the sound.Mannnn, I found myself laughing out loud every time I discovered a new feature of these lil things.In closing, they are far better than any large headphones I've ever owned and possess great HIGH QUALITY sound that I've NEVER expected nor experienced in any headphones.  Completely shocked and pleased with my purchase and HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMEND at this point.Now the true and final test will be how long will they last?  If you don't hear from me again, they're still going strong.  If I run into problems, I'll be back to let you know!Read more"
"Sony WH-CH520 Wireless Headphones Bluetooth On-Ear Headset with Microphone and up to 50 Hours Battery Life with Quick Charging, Blue",,4.5 out of 5 stars,"22,241","I bought these because I needed something that would allow me to enjoy music, pod casts and many other videos without being tied to my desk computer or iPhone. One main reason is I needed something that sounded good but nothing overly priced like my AirPods Pro that only get about 2 hours of listening.  These are rated for up to 50 hours. And the best part was the fact they were inexpensive connect to more than one bluetooth device (my M4 Mac mini and my iPhone 14) in addition I needed something to be able to have a conversation if my phone rings while I am on my Mac. and these have worked so far flawlessly.Set up was a bit more then I expected I figured connect via bluetooth and off I would go but no, I did have to download the app to fine-tune the Headphones which wasn't a big deal. While they are not of the highest quality they are perfect for me and my listening needs.Incoming calls were a breeze and everyone I spoke to so far while wearing them had no issues hearing me.  Now, I am a bit amphrehensive about the battery life because at the whole day yesterday of wearing them the battery monitor on my Mac claim the headphones were still 100%. and if that is true then they are even better than I was expecting battery wise.  I did recharge them over night because I wasn't sure if the Mac was telling me the truth.The voice interaction with my phone calls were very clear and I have no complaints.The fit is really nice if you ask me and they are very light weight, after wearing them almost all day I would forget they were on and have to take em off.They are very comfortable to wear and I noticed just how light they were when I pulled them off and carried them over to where I plugged them in to re-charge.Of course it's only been a couple of days so, if I can edit this review at a later time I will do so, if there is a need to. I mean after only a few days these are brand new so I do need to give them more time.  Surprisingly, my ears have not began to sweat with them being on all day, although. I do have issues with my ears being itchy from time to time but that's not because of the headset. That's just my ears.For the price the quality for me is really good.I may listen to a song or two but, I mainly wanted something to last longer than 2 hours if I watch YouTube or other streaming videos on my computer or iPhone. As well, they release my nice wired set that I used, I got tired of tripping over the wire and my office chair rolling over the cord and getting tangled up.  Plus the added convenience of being able to get up from my desk and walk around my Apartment when I need to while I am listening to something is what I was aiming for.The quality again for me is really good, I am not a sound engineer so I could not tell you where on the spectrum of sound they fit but for the price to me they do the job I expect of them.  All around a good pair of headphones for the price.Battery life may not be up to 50 hours because the battery monitor remained at 100% even though I had them on almost all day.  But, they certainly lasted well past the 2 - 5 hours of wearing them compared to a pair of Apple AirPod Pros.  I still want to kick myself for buying the Apple ones not realizing for the price they didn't last very long on a single charge.I highly recommend.Read more"
"M1 Wireless Retro Headphones, Noise Reduction Headset, 50H Playback Time, High-Resolution Audio, Bass, Memory Foam Earplug, Suitable for Travel,Fitness or Home Office",$24.74,4.3 out of 5 stars,29,"I have over 25-years in IT.  Every once-in-a-while I am thoroughly surprised.  I typically use Headphones in the $350 - $500 Range [Audiophile Grade], with a nice Flat Balanced Engineered Tone [These are not quite there, in the beginning, but do come close after the Burn-In process, so be patient].At first I got a somewhat unpleasant tone across the spectrum, All Bass [Below 300 Hz] was subdued and the High end was quite present.  This is rather typical with On-Ear Headphones, prior to the Drivers loosening up before the Burn-In [see below].  They did improve considerably after about 24-hours [see below for more detail].After about 24 hours of Burn-In time [see below] the Drivers loosened-up, these Headphones still had a bit of a muted Bass but significantly better than before, and really became enjoyable.  These do have a beautiful Design, physically and in the Engineered Audio Tuning.The On-Ear Ear Pads are extremely soft and comfortable, even Passively Blocking Exterior Noise to a point, I get the sense of an Over-the-Ear Headphone for extended comfortable use.  All this is subjective [everyone has their own audio and comfort preference].  It did take some time and adjustment to finally get enough compression so outside noise was suppressed [again - to a point - but enough to allow the drivers to compensate]  I have to applaud the Perfell Engineers, in providing the EarPads the ability to tilt/rotate [front to back], this allowed me to aim them directly into my ear canals, which provided the cleanest audio and improved the Passive Noise Cancellation and comfort [so feel free to experiment with the EarPad placement].  Additionally for adding the Voice-Prompts rather than nonsensical tones, particularly in such an inexpensive item, this shows me they believe in quality, which is evident in the impressive build, bravo!I do have to note that these [as all Headphones] require about 40-hours of use [generally referred to as a Burn-In Period] for the Drivers to loosen up to reach their full potential.  These only needed about 24-hours [not contiguous, just overall time of use].  I much prefer just using the Headphones, you will hear the Drivers loosen up over time.  This will give you the best representation of the Headphones Engineered Tuning and Audio Profile, so be patient when judging any Headphones.I really wanted to love them at first, but I found I had to wait through the Burn-In process for the Drivers to come to life, so the beauty in this Headphones Engineering and Tuning could shine. Just be patient.  I really like the Company and their Staff.All I can say further is be patient, you will come to enjoy these as much as I do.  Enjoy!Read more"

When I unpacked the buds I notice immediately that the angle of the buds and the tightness of the loop are different from any others of mine.I put them in and they fit much better than any I have tried-snug and secure. I started pairing to my phone and they paired extremely quickly- no hassle on my part to help the process along or to find them on the  menu-they were just there. A nice surprise.Everything came at 98% charged so I could use it right away.I started out with some Mozart(a good way to check the sound in all ranges) and then went to the Beatles and then Iron Butterfly.The sound quality was excellent.Only one button on each side and very intuitive to use. If you desire you can only use one bud at a time(I sleep on my left side and just wear the right button to listen to the radio to go to sleep by, so the one button option is a must for me!).The buds and case seem well constructed and I anticipate them lasting a long time(longer than my very very expensive Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 did....but I best not get on a rampage about them!!).All-in-all I am well pleased with my purchase and they truly deserve the 5 star rating I gave them.I hope this review has been helpful to you in your search for a quality and well made over-the-ear bud set.Read more"

"Sony WH-CH720N Noise Canceling Wireless Headphones Bluetooth Over The Ear Headset with Microphone and Alexa Built-in, Black New",$78.00,4.4 out of 5 stars,"10,494","SECOND UPDATE  - 11/9/2023OK, so I have been living with these for a couple of months now and I feel I can say some things with more confidence.1. Comfort is still a bit hit or miss. I will say the choice to put those microphones or whatever those things that stick out on the insides of the earcups was not great. I don't always feel them pressing on my ears but the earpads are not very thick and if you don't have them on in exactly the right way (assuming you can find a way that works for you) then the pads will flatten a bit and you'll feel them on your ears. It's not exactly painful. Just unpleasant.2. And I feel the need to come back to the ear cushions themselves. Again, they just barely fit over my ears. And I wear glasses so this is a big issue with most headphones. I can sometimes get the cushions just right so they don't smash the tips of my ears against the arms of my glasses too much but it sometimes takes a bit of extra fiddling around with them that can be annoying when I'm not in the mood for it. Again, not too much of a knock against Sony since this is a widespread issue with headphones in general. Manufacturers just seem to think if they make the cushions soft, they will be comfortable. Nope. If it smashes your ears, it will start to hurt after a while no matter how soft it is.3. The battery life is decent but I do find myself having to charge them more often than I expected. Prior to these, I had an inexpensive pair of Jlab headphones and although their sound quality and features were lacking, the battery life was outstanding and I was just used to not charging for days and days. I pretty much wear headphones all day every day and I generally find that these will be at 50% after a couple of days. Of course that's with noise cancelling on. But also, these are noise cancelling headphones so they were designed to be used with it on for long periods. Or should have been. I don't know what the capacity of the battery is in these but the battery packs they use in wireless headphones are not expensive items anymore. You can buy a set of $30 wireless headphones now with a huge capacity battery. So, yes. These are lower end Sony but they're still well above the price you pay for really basic wireless headphones. They shouldn't have skimped on the battery capacity.That said, though I haven't actually kept track of how many hours, it probably does meet the stated runtime. I had just hoped they were being conservative with the numbers. But also, you can't use them and charge them at the same time so if you use your headphones constantly, that can be annoying. I don't like to run lithium batteries much below 50%. I don't know that it's bad for them exactly but all of my lithium batteries have lasted me for many years using that policy so that's what I do. When I see 40-50% I charge the battery. I know they have the quick charge feature but I like to charge and forget for many hours. It would be more useful if I could plug into a power bank for 15 minutes and still use the headphones while it's charging. But nope. You plug into a charger and the headphones turn off.Everything said, I'm reasonably happy with them but I paid the $150 asking price they were selling for when I bought them. Knowing all I know now, I would not pay that price again for these. These are $70 headphones. Tops. They're not that comfortable. The battery life is easily matched (or surpassed) by the least expensive wireless headphones on Amazon. The stock sound quality is not impressive at all. (I will say they sound pretty good if you tweak the EQ). The only things I have been really happy about is once I got them paired with my PC, they always connect right away when I turn them on. That's something that is hit or miss with most bluetooth devices. And can be incredibly annoying when you have to fight to get something connected every single time. I've also been pretty satisfied with the noise cancelling. Which they're the first NC headphones I've ever owned so I have nothing to compare them to.I'm not really understanding what Sony was trying to do with these. Their top of the line ANC headphones might be some of the best ANC but are they really $400 good? Well, if they're anything like these, they are good but significantly overpriced.UPDATE - 9/25/2023I realize my original review is a bit long and probably most people don't want to read all that so after living with these for a week or so, here are some key points that I think people will want to know.1. Comfort is just OK for people with small or medium ears that don't stick out too far. Beyond that, the comfort might be anything from uncomfortable to painful.2. The ANC is good enough for me. I don't fly. I don't use them on a bus or train or anything. I use them at home. They block out things like computer fans and voices in adjacent rooms. I have a fan right by my head and although I can still hear it, the ANC really tames it to a very gentle hiss. If voices or TV are in the same room with you, it will cause them to seem to recede quite a bit but you will still probably hear them (especially TV). The ANC works better on some frequencies than others. It almost eliminates some noises but (for example) the sound of water running nearby is something you will definitely hear.3. I use these 90% with my Windows 10 PC and I have not experienced any of the disconnection issues that many have reported with them as long as I am only using them with my PC. However, when I do connect them to my Android phone, if I leave them connected for a while, things can get glitchy and if I then turn off the bluetooth on my phone, it will sometimes make weird things happen. Like if I have the ANC turned on on the headphones, it will turn off and forget the EQ settings I have chosen. Also, sometimes when I try to disconnect them from the phone by simply turning off bluetooth, they don't make the disconnect sound. I don't know. I'm glad I didn't buy them to use exclusively with the phone. I have a different set of headphones for that. I just wanted to include this in my review to note that I did indeed notice some issues when I left them connected to my phone for a while. I will be keeping them because PC is all I care about.END UPDATE---------------------ORIGINAL REVIEWThings that mattered to me in choosing these headphones...1. I'm not going to try and sugar coat this too much. I don't have money to burn. But a set of headphones that check all my boxes without doing anything I hate for a price I can handle is a tall order. Good headphones have never been cheap. ANC is still a premium feature (though this is changing fast). These headphones were just barely in my price range at $150. And frankly, although I like everything about them (so far) I think $100 would have been closer to the price these should be selling for. This segment of the market is crowded and if I was willing to gamble even more than I did, I could have probably gotten something I was happy with for significantly less than that $150. I went with Sony because I'm an old guy and I know that you usually don't pay more for a Sony product for no reason.2. Comfort. Of course, we're talking perceived comfort. Comfort involves a lot of guesswork. For these, it appears that I mostly guessed right. These just fit my ears with a little pressure here and there. My ears are not small but also not that large. If you have large ears, you should probably go somewhere where you can try the headphones on before you buy. I probably should have done this myself because comfort is always my top priority (other than price). Most likely the pads on these will not be difficult to replace should the need arise. And it usually does with headphones. Sooner or later, the pads will always wear out.3. ANC - Of course. This is my first pair of ANC headphones and it's everything I want. The transparency mode is slightly quieter than I would like but it's acceptable. I've seen some people complaining about the ANC not being effective on these. Not sure what they're talking about but maybe they're coming from much higher end ANC. For me, the first day I had them, I had some people come to see me and they were banging on my door. I heard absolutely nothing. They were freaked out because they thought something was wrong. So....my verdict on this is if you want perfect ANC, maybe shop around. I'm not here to tell you it's the best. I don't have anything to compare it to. I can only say it leaves me wanting nothing and I'm happy with it.4. Sound quality - Out of the box, I found the factory sound to be lacking. But that usually happens with me when I have new headphones. I can't say for sure if the burn in effect is psychological or real but all I can say is a new pair of headphones takes some getting used to for me. At least the EQ is sufficiently adjustable in the app and I managed to get them to sound very nice. It's nice that the settings you choose in the app will be stored in the headphones so the same settings will apply on other devices. I mostly use Bluetooth headphones on my Windows 10 PC so I'm not going to be fiddling around with the app much.These can go pretty loud and have decent bass. The drivers can provide good clarity for mids and highs if you fiddle with the EQ. The stock EQ sounds muffled. But that also might be a result of them not having been burned in.CONS - It's really nitpicking for me to find many cons. These are great headphones (at least initially).1. The buttons could be a bit more tactile. In particular, I find the play/pause button a bit difficult to find and always find myself hunting for it. It is right between the Vol +/- buttons and should stick out a little more than it does to make it obvious. Also, the ANC button is nearly flush with the earcup and still makes me hunt for it a bit more than I like. I think I'll get used to these buttons eventually but I don't love them.2. The shortest timer for the auto off that's available in the app is 15 minutes. I was really kind of surprised that there was no option for a shorter time.3. The headband is adjustable by clicks. So if the size you need is between two clicks, you might have to have them slightly too tight or slightly too loose. The higher end Sony headbands with no clicks seem like they would be better in this way.4. Although (as I said) the comfort is pretty good, it's not great. But this is not terribly unusual for lower end headphones. I strongly prefer over ear (earcups that surround the ears rather than sit on them and smash them) and I'm very picky about it. I don't like it if my ears are not completely inside the earcups and I don't think it's asking much since my ears are not enormous. I find that these do kind of smash the tops of my ears. It's not something I notice right away but after about half an hour or so, it starts to become something I'm almost constantly aware of. It's not exactly painful but it isn't really pleasant either.To make matters worse, there is a seam in the fake leather that runs all the way around the inside where your ear is probably gonna be if your ears are just slightly larger than the ears of a child. I find that many of these types of earpads have that seam and I don't know it's purpose but I know that ones that don't have it tend to be easier on your ears even if your ears don't fit perfectly. So all I'm saying is this isn't some upstart company. This is Sony. These are low end Sony headphones but they're still not really cheap and they're still made by an enormous company that's been around for many decades. I don't know what it is. Almost every company that makes headphones of this sort makes the earcups too small for even slightly larger ears. I guess they think people with larger ears don't use headphones. Of course my ears could be really large. In which case, I probably wouldn't be able to wear them even if they were a little larger.5. Also, I have to kind of agree with all the other reviews that mentioned the little plastic part that sticks out from the area where the driver is on the inside of the earcup. I am not sure if it actually pushes on my ears or not but it seems like it might. I kind of feel something and it does stick out far enough to where I can see how it could rub your ears.I think these pieces are the place where the microphones are mounted so if that's the case, they kind of have to be there but they probably don't have to be as poorly designed as they are. I feel like I might be able to trim some of the plastic off if I really wanted to but I'm not going to start working on a brand new set of $150 headphones. It doesn't bother me (yet) so maybe I'll change my mind later on. I think this could have been avoided if the padding were a bit thicker on the earpads.Read more"

The over the ear piece does a decent job of half-way dampening the intensity of a busy thirty people sevenhundredish square feet  industrial room.Love that the oval design covers my ears all around as that was a critical feature  I desired andxhose these after  I searched high and low through amazon to find a model that specifically had an OVAL design and this one does! Because it helps ro fully enclose the ears to have a better affect of dampening incoming ambient sounds.  Love the battery life is excellent lasts almost two days left on constantly sonce  I forget to turn off and fall asleep comfortably using it all night to drown out mdh cpap snorrings.  It does a great kob to connect and disconnect and swap from calls to videos to spotify! There have been a few times when it was even anle to overlay spotify background with instagram voice but thats a unreliable fluke experience. Buy buy buy!!! Love this thing!!! Great option for the price.  I took some nail polish to the seafom grean colored one and customized it.  I love that it colapses and rotates and folds. It is made for right handed use tho and the long press for volume controls are the same buttons that when single pressrd advance skipnext or repeat songs.. there are only three buttons so its not confising at all to use and they have good click tactility.  It has lights to indicate on (blue slow flashing) and turning off/charging (red) and no lights when turned off.  It helps keep me more calm in busy environments as the wear is comfortable and has a non sticky soft feel. I prefer using over the ear options as my neurodivergent ears can ªt tolerate inserted options easily. When wearing these the ambient sounds are slightly dulled out so it is decent enough to listen to music and still enjoy a conversation if you wish or pretend that you can ªt hear anyone if you wish haha!  .. but dulled just enough that  I can still more or less unless they are speaking really softly ..understand close five feet conversation and not be too overwhelmed by my sound sensitivities.  If you are looking for an economicallly sound option of over the ear portable lightweight collapsible foldable good batterylife without the noisecancelling shennanigans this one is it without regrets. I found a way to use a watch dial to make the volume that much softer than the regular on device or phone button volume control is capable of maneuvering if you start out with a medium volume level to begin you can get just a few more not hes of less volume. The device  is capable of going pretty loud but struggles to go really soft for someone typical this probably isn ªt any issue to fret over but for someone with extreemely high sensitivity to sound this takes noting not yo expect supervsift sound capability without going the extra mile to dial down every sound monitoring option in settings of both device and in the player of originating sounds. The rotation of the over the ear piece only goes one 90 degree way and not 180 to the opposite way.  That is a piece of information not readily accessible unless you are trying it out. Depending on how far out you extend the over the head piece, it can make it more or less snug over your ears while balancing on and possibly compromising on height of wearing the over the head area of the over the head and ears phones.  I mean that if you put the phone on without extending out the length of the top it can feel looser on the part of the ears but if you extend then it can create more pressure on the ears.. basically if you have a very tall head and your head is also wide then it might feel a bit tighter which could translate to better sound muffling from the snug tight fit of the earphones but if you have a short head that is wide it might not feel as snug based on how you extend or unextend the headpiece.  These are Neurodivergent details here, not for the feint of neurotypical i could carelessJargon about tightness of fit.  I wasnt spevifically looking for a noisecancelling feature and i ªm very happy with the ability of these non noisecanceling overthe ear headphones to dampen just enough to still have conversation but not annihilate  ambient sounds! If uou generally are facing someone who tends to speak too loudly for your comfort then you will love having these on while conversating.  I found the accent of the person who speaks to announce  ª powher ongg connected ª vs pohwehrg ogf ª ª when pushing hold down center button to turn on/off the device, a bit interesting as a french american english speaker.My take overall? Heck yeah go for it. This would make a great gift!!!Over the ear deaigns that actually are oval and are able to cover your entire ear are much more possible of ability to dampen ambient sounds and to feel more comfortable and not cause pressure on ear cartilage.  I wish more models and higher end brands of popularity would realize and incorporate this oval over the war headphone/earphone feature into their designs!!!!!!!Read more"
"Soundcore Anker Life Q20 Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Headphones, Wireless Over Ear Bluetooth Headphones, 70H Playtime, Hi-Res Audio, Deep Bass, Memory Foam Ear Cups, Travel, Office, USB-C Charging",$37.99,4.4 out of 5 stars,"2,700","TL;DR: If you‚Äôre on a tight budget and are looking for high quality headphones that are great for every use imaginable, these are for you.I‚Äôve had these headphones for almost two months now, and I cannot stress enough how shocked I am at their quality for their price.For a bit of backstory, I‚Äôm a young person who lives alone and who generally has a fairly tight budget. I‚Äôve been wanting over the ear headphones for a long time, but couldn‚Äôt reconcile the cost of the big name brands like Sony, Beats, Apple, etc. I randomly decided to do a bit of market research to see if there were any good quality options in my price range (which, I‚Äôll admit, was very limited). After a long night of reading reviews and comparing prices, I decided to go with these headphones. I thought ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre under $50, so I‚Äôm sure they won‚Äôt be amazing quality, but they should do the trick for a couple years.‚ÄùAfter using these daily for two months, I cannot explain enough how impressed I am with the quality of these budget headphones. First off, the noise settings - the active noise cancelling is genuinely impressive. It does a better job than my in-ear Bose active noise cancelling headphones, which were 4 times the price. The bass setting is my preferred setting for music listening, as I‚Äôm someone who really enjoys physically feeling music when I listen to it. I‚Äôm not an audio expert by any means, but I am someone who cares a lot about music and my listening experience, and these headphones have bested every high-priced in ear headphone I‚Äôve ever used (Apple, Bose, Beats, etc.). You don‚Äôt have to turn the volume up very much to get some good depth in this setting, which is nice. It does dampen the noise cancelling a bit, but when you‚Äôre listening to music you really can‚Äôt notice at all. The transparency setting is really useful for when I use these at work, as I can stay tuned into a meeting but still be aware of my surroundings.Physically, they‚Äôre so comfortable that I forget I‚Äôm wearing them. The foam padding is very plush and soft, and the headphones don‚Äôt feel tight on my ears at all. One slight issue is the size adjustment, at their smallest size they‚Äôre still slightly too big for me, but that‚Äôs a very small issue that I only notice when reclined/exercising. They‚Äôre very lightweight as well, I never even notice it.They also are so amazingly easy to connect to multiple devices. I have these headphones connected to my laptop, phone, and TV at any given time, and they easily switch from one to the other automatically when needed. For example, I can have my headphones on watching TV (which is great, as I live in an apartment with thin walls and I have hearing issues), and if I watch a video on my phone, they will automatically switch to my phone, then switch back to my TV when I resume my show.They‚Äôre also so pretty?? I got the pink ones, and they have a beautiful pearlescent exterior that I just love. I get compliments on it all the time!!My only issues with these headphones are so exceptionally minor that they don‚Äôt even warrant any stars off. The first is the control system - I truly cannot figure out how to skip/replay songs. I know you‚Äôre SUPPOSED to be able to do it, but no matter what arrangement I seem to press the correct button it, it doesn‚Äôt do anything but pause/play. It‚Äôs possible this is my own user error, as I threw away the user manual and haven‚Äôt looked it up, so that‚Äôs on me lol.The other slight issue I have with them is that they don‚Äôt really come with much of a carrying case. They come with a drawstring bag, which was nice until I immediately lost it because it‚Äôs significantly harder to keep track of than an actual hard-sided case. They also don‚Äôt actually offer much protection for the headphones other than from scratches, so a hard-side case would be awesome. But honestly, those complaints are so minor and irrelevant that I genuinely do not care!!All in all, I cannot recommend these enough. They are scarily good for their price, demonstrating once again that the free market is a sham and brand recognition sells more than actual product quality!!!Read more"
TAGRY Wireless Earbuds Blueetooth Headphones 80Hrs Playtime Power Display IPX7 Waterproof Sport Ear Buds with Deep Bass in Ear Earphones for Running Workout Exercise Gym Black,$47.48,4.8 out of 5 stars,272,"I have had my pair of X88 sport earbuds for a couple of weeks now and I am very happy with their performance. The earhooks keep the units securely fastened in place and make them comfortable to wear. With three different sizes of eartips I found one that fit my ear channel perfectly to help block out external sounds. The multifunction buttons are easy to use and handle multiple functions. I like the carrying case as well. It clearly shows the amount of charge remaining before it has to be recharge. The earbud batteries seem to have a pretty long life as well. I find the sound to be great also.One paired, these earbuds automatically reconnect with the device it was paired with when taken out of their case. If you want to change the device you want to use them with, you may need to turn Bluetooth off on the previous device until they pair with the new device. Otherwise they will remain paired with the original device.Read more"

"Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Headphones, Wireless Headphones with Active Over Ear Noise Cancelling and Mic, Deep Bass, Up to 24 Hours of Playtime, Blue Dusk - Limited Edition Color",,4.6 out of 5 stars,"11,521","This is my first pair of Bose headphones. Initial impressions before even putting them on was ‚ÄúDang, these are expensive headphones,‚Äù and at $349.99, yes, they are. There‚Äôs hundreds of headphones on the market, many of them with noise cancelling, that are available for far less money. But, considering my first pair of ANC Headphones were the original Beats by Dr. Dre Studios, and adjusted for inflation since 2011, I paid $416 for those, these are certainly more than competitive. Also, there‚Äôs a reason that for the past several years, when people bring up noise cancelling headphones, they are usually talking about Sony or Bose as their reference point. They are quality. They do the job well. Let‚Äôs dive in.1. ANC2. Comfort3. Sound4. Build Quality5. Feature Set6. Who should buy these?Ok, so as I said, my previous ANC Headphones are the original Beats Studios, and my most recent over the ear headphones purchase was the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x back in 2017. I‚Äôll be comparing these to my experience with the both of them. Maybe also in comparison to my gaming headset, the Razer Barracuda X.First off, the noise cancelling itself, since this lineup is called QUIETComfort. Pretty darn good. Honestly, I can‚Äôt say that it‚Äôs any better than my reference point of headphones from 2011, but still positive experience. Blocks out basically all voices (except the higher range like baby cries), and I couldn‚Äôt hear any other noise around me when in use. Can‚Äôt complain.Now for the QuietCOMFORT portion of the equation. Compared to both of my previous headphones, it‚Äôs a serious improvement. The Beats and Audio-Technica both were heavy over the top of my skull, creating discomfort over extensive sessions where I would shift the band forward and backward over my head to give a break to the affected area. My Razer Barracuda X are also lightweight, and up to this point were the most comfortable in this regards, but the Bose definitely have more padding on the band. That said, I still have experienced the same over the skull discomfort with these headphones, and the band has to be loosened to address it. Obviously, that means the headphones overall sit more loosely on my head and are less secure.The earcups have sufficient padding for my ears, and they don‚Äôt make contact, so though they are shallow, they aren‚Äôt as shallow as others I‚Äôve owned where the speaker housings press against the outer cartilage of my ear. This, again makes for a comfortable experience over time. Like other headphones I‚Äôve owned, definitely heat buildup inside the earcups, and these are no exception, with condensation gathering on the material. Yep, I was sweaty listening to these. But I live in the desert, so there‚Äôs that. Your experience may vary based on your location and if you run generally warm or not.The sound quality over playback is pleasant, and anything I‚Äôve found unpleasant I can adjust easily with the Bose app to tune the EQ to my liking. I blame anything I haven‚Äôt liked to my various EQ settings (iOS, Spotify, Bose app combinations) and the source of the audio (Spotify streaming) more than the quality of the sound itself. Both my ATH-M50x and Barracuda X have mostly neutral sound, with the ATH being legitimate studio monitors being only slightly warm and the Barracuda having neutral with slight emphasis to bass for obvious reasons: gaming you want to hear footsteps, and higher bass emphasis aids immersion in game. Obviously, the Beats were very warm, and had bass emphasized beyond the Barracudas. So if I were to place the Bose in the comparison, I‚Äôd say its default sound is warm, not neutral, but definitely not as bass heavy as anything Beats put out in 2011 (and from what I read, remains bass heavy in the present). These aren‚Äôt studio monitors or reference headphones or audiophile headphones. They‚Äôre meant to just make your music sound good with little fuss, with the ability to tune to your liking. If you want audiophile headphones, neither Bose nor Sony nor Beats offerings in this segment meet that criteria. If you want bass heavy headphones, Bose, Sony, JBL have extensive options in that regards at several price points. As already stated, this meets the middle ground between neutral and bass emphasized. It‚Äôs warm out of the box, but not at the detriment of the rest of the range. Everything from low to high is clear and crisp. Nothing is overly harsh.Build quality is a little bit of a concern of mine. It‚Äôs very hard to find a set of headphones not made entirely out of plastic and no exception here. The inherent design of my OG Beats, though also loaded with plastic, felt sturdier, but the only moving points on those were the hinges, and to a far lesser degree, the cups moved on slight swivels to lay flat on your head. So it makes sense that they‚Äôd feel sturdy when there wasn‚Äôt a lot of pivot and rotation points. On these, the headphones have folding and rotating ear cups, and at all points across the build, there feels like there‚Äôs flex in it. I worry very much that my toddler or baby would get a hold of them and twist them to pieces. I don‚Äôt have that concern with either my Audio-Technica headphones, also mostly plastic, nor the Corsair gaming headset my toddler uses for his drum kit, which gets tossed around, stepped on, kicked around, and keeps on going just fine. But, as previously stated, the material choice keeps weight down, which keeps comfort high, like my Barracuda X. Both have lots of lightweight plastic. Both need to be kept away from kids that don‚Äôt know how to treat things with delicate touch. Though I know people do go for a run or workout with these, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it. I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôd survive a fall, and they‚Äôre not IPX rated anyhow against sweat or other moisture. Seriously, get some IPX rated headphones or use some earbuds for sweaty, motion filled sessions. Keep these for the office, study, travel, and everyday listening. With that said, these still feel like a premium product. They don‚Äôt feel cheap. I‚Äôm just leveling with anyone that is considering these of what their limitations may be.Feature set for these is quite extensive, and y‚Äôall can do your research on every last bit. Will just point out some things I was curious about when I purchased these.- The ANC has two presets: Quiet and Aware. You can craft your own presets in the app, and adjust them based on your liking and whether or not you think you‚Äôll encounter wind. So far I find these basically pointless. I don't need to fine tune how much ANC I have. I either want to hear things, or don't.- The app also supports any firmware updates and allows you to tune your EQ to your liking. I can‚Äôt stand that there‚Äôs multiple Bose apps. I use one for these headphones and one for my Soundlink Flex. I really wish Bose would consolidate all their consumer, portable audio (meaning headphones, earbuds, and travel speakers) into one app. I don‚Äôt know why I need two apps for devices that both come and go with me. I‚Äôd be more forgiving of multiple apps along portable products versus home products (such as in-wall speakers and home theater speakers). It's especially confusing when the Soundlink Flex MAX is in the Bose Music app with the QuietComforts, but the Soundlink Flex is not. So weird, so pointless. Anyhow, I digress.- Like all QC lineups, these headphones also support analog playback over a traditional cable. They also all feature an asymmetric plug arrangement, 2.5mm on one end and 3.5mm on the other. Unlike the more expensive QuietComfort Ultras, this pair of headphones I‚Äôm reviewing allows for passive playback. If you run out of charge or are preserving charge, you can still use these without ANC and listen over the cable. And it has in-line mic as well. This gives you far more flexibility than the Ultras, and allows these headphones to serve double duty as an in-a-pinch gaming headset for an Xbox controller, and to continue to support phone calls, etc. through the in-line microphone even if you cannot or choose not to power them on. I cannot believe that Bose‚Äôs flagship product, the Ultras, do not offer that same versatility. This product would be even better if you could use these speakers powered but without ANC features (quiet or aware) enabled to conserve battery power, but retain the convenience of wireless.- Driver size is 35mm to the Ultras 40mm. My ATH-M50x, aptly named, are closer to 50mm drivers, and I believe the Barracuda X are 40mm or so. But the playback volume on the Bose seems louder and, obviously is more versatile than my analog only ATH-M50x comparison. The Barracuda, also wireless, are still less versatile in that they require the USB-C dongle or the analog cable to function, and lack ANC. Bluetooth 5+ is just far more versatile, even if it has latency that the aforementioned devices do not.- Main differences between these and the Ultras include the driver size (Ultra is larger), the amount of microphones used for ANC (the Ultra has more), the inclusion of Immersive Audio on the Ultras (like Spatial Audio on Apple‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm honestly not sold by that at this time), battery life (these are longer than the Ultra), and the physical structure of them differ. These are just another rehash of the QC35, QC45 design, the Ultras are unique in their structure.They arrived at 60% charge and I listened to them for about 30 minutes before placing them on a USB-C charger. Within an hour I was at 100%. Could‚Äôve been quicker. Idk. Was in the backyard playing with the kiddos and listening to the Bose Soundlink Flex (go buy one of those, I‚Äôd recommend that to anybody).So, who are these headphones for? A lot of people, but let‚Äôs face it, $349.99 will price out a lot of buyers. I‚Äôd recommend my existing ATH-M50x to people that want to spend under $200 and only care about reliable sound. I‚Äôd recommend Sony ULT ANC Headphones for people with $200 to spend that want ANC and plan on listening to Pop, Hip-Hop, EDM (their ANC is nearly as good as XM5, Sony‚Äôs competitor to these Bose‚Ä¶ but they‚Äôre very bass heavy). I‚Äôd recommend Audio-Technica again to people with a budget of $100.These are a luxury product. I‚Äôm aware that there are headphones far more expensive than these. But these are still expensive to many people. At this price point, I‚Äôd expect no less than 5 years of usage, and as I‚Äôve already stated, I‚Äôve used $150 headphones for 7 years now. So with that said, a couple of points of advice to someone weighing investing into these:- These go on sale periodically down to $249.99. At that price, they‚Äôre still premium, but far more competitive against the likes of Sony XM5 and Apple AirPods Max.- Bose Refurbished is a great option. The warranty is exactly the same as the brand new product, and you save money. I‚Äôve done just that with my Soundlink Flex and have been so happy. I‚Äôm doing it again with the QuietComfort Ultras, which I snagged at $259.99, instead of their new list price of $429.99.Okay, enough money talk. Back to who these are for. If you made it this far, the $249.99-$349.99 is obviously something you‚Äôre considering as a fair value.So with that said, if you are a professional or student that wants to block out the noise around you for hours on end so you can work, these are for you.If you use public transport and want headphones to help you escape the noise, these are for you. Just, uh, be aware of your surroundings. Ya know, be safe. Yadda yadda.If you want legendary ANC, comfort, sound quality as you go through the airport and on your plane, these are for you.If you want some good headphones for the gym, I‚Äôd say you won‚Äôt be disappointed, but I‚Äôd encourage you to do some research for other headphones before you make a plan to routinely sweat into or potentially toss about headphones that are not made for either.If you‚Äôre the type of parent that wants to spoil your kid with great headphones, I‚Äôd say keep looking unless you find your child as responsible and respectful as a grown adult. I would certainly have broken these as a kid, and maybe even as a teen out of negligence (i.e. tossing my loaded backpack around or something and accidentally smashing something inside or nearby, hard case or not). There are many great headphones out there for less money, and some that are more sturdy. If you want to bless your child that way, do some serious research first, amongst serious review websites that breakdown sound quality, build quality, etc.Wow, look at you! You made it through my Amazon novel! I mean review. Yeah, that's what I meant. Hope it gave you some things to think about as you find the perfect headphones for you. That Cypress Green sure looks good though, right? Ok, bye bye bye now.Read more"
"Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless Premium Noise Canceling Overhead Headphones with Mic for Phone-Call and Alexa Voice Control, Black WH1000XM4",$193.00,4.6 out of 5 stars,"60,181","**Disclaimer: I bought mine used like new through AmazonI originally purchased the Sony XM5 because they were soooo highly rated in every article I read. I returned the XM5, got the XM4 and am so much happier. I'll compare the XM4 to the XM5, Apple AirPods Max, and Bose QuietComfort 45 - just to help anyone choosing between them.**Noise Cancellation (4.5/5): the noise cancellation on the XM4 is crazy, almost comparable to the Apple AirPods Max. I gave the XM4 a 4.5 because I still think the Apple AirPods Max have the best noise cancellation, but the Sony XM4 is very close. I also like the fact that you can turn noise cancelling on/off with a button - which is a feature not available with the Bose QuietComfort 45. The noise cancellation is much better than the XM5 and less finicky. An issue with the XM5 is that the noise cancelling would just randomly turn on/off. Like if I paused a video for a little too long, the noise cancellation would just turn off Overall, I wouldn't say I it blocks out all sound, but it's close. I can hear the sound of people talking and music, but it's quieter and I can't make out the words. I definitely can't have a conversation with them on. Also, the XM4 will pick up on when you're talking to people and turn the noise cancelling off for you - but it does make a little announcement when it does that may be annoying or disruptive.**Sound Quality (4/5): the sound quality is great. Way better than the XM5, not as great as the Apple AirPods Max.  I think the Apple headphones are just a little crisper. I think it's cool that you can turn 360 sound on, but tbh I never really use it (XM5 also has this feature). The sound is clear, and I haven't experienced any malfunctions/issues with the noise. When I had the XM5, they would just randomly sound muffled (like I was underwater) and, when that wasn't happening, the sound quality was mediocre.**Comfort (5/5): the XM4s are REALLY comfy. I wear glasses with plastic frames and a lot of headphones just don't work and are really uncomfy. The Apple AirPods Max were really uncomfortable with my glasses. Obviously, an easy solution is to just wear contacts, but I hate wearing my contacts for long periods of time - especially, when I study/do work. The XM5 were also pretty comfortable, but wouldn't stay fixed when I adjusted them - they would slip and I would need to readjust them a lot. The XM4 completely cover my ear and the ear pads are soft. They don't squeeze my head the way other headphones do and they don't hurt any part of my ear. I will say that the headband part that rests on top of my head does kind of hurt my head after wearing them for almost 10 hours. Also, I have TMJ so sometimes wearing the headphones does cause my TMJ to flare up and I'll switch to earbuds. But, I think overall these are the most comfortable headphones I have tried.**Product Quality (3.5/5): let's be honest, they're plastic and they feel plastic. They don't feel like super high quality, but let me tell you that they feel way better quality than the XM5 - those felt like a barbie toy. I think the XM4 are sturdy and pretty durable. The Apple AirPods Max are also plastic, but do feel a little more high quality - but also, nothing spectacular.**Aesthetic (3.5/5): If the aesthetic is important to you, I would say they look fine. They're a little bulky, but not terrible. Not as sleek as some others, but they don't look ridiculous. If you're really against a bulky look, then they may not be a great aesthetic match for you. I was worried they would be really clunky, but after getting them and wearing them for a bit, I really don't think they look bad.**Connectivity (4/5): I only have Apple devices (iPhone, MacBook, etc.) and I think the connectivity is great with these products! When I got the XM5, they had so many connection issues. I wasn't able to connect them to my laptop, they wouldn't stay connected to my devices - it was a mess. I was really worried I would have the same issues with the XM4, but I have had no problems so far. I will say it was a little odd to have have to download the Sony Connect app and manage the headphone through that platform, but it's user friendly and it's kind of nice to have a control for them (it's almost like a remote).**Battery Life (5/5): The battery life is insane. I've had them for 8 days and have not charged them yet - they still have about 40% charge left. They will turn off automatically to save battery life if you don't use them for a certain amount of time, which I personally like.OVERALL (4.5/5): I think the XM4 are great headphones for a better price than the Apple AirPods Max. The Bose are apparently really similar, but I've never personally tried them. The XM4 is MUCH better than the XM5 in terms of quality and price. They're comfy, great noise cancellation and sound quality, and have great battery life.Read more"

I first took a chance on this brand about 2-3 years ago (I‚Äôd have to check amazon to be sure) and I am so glad I did. In fact, the main reason I purchased a second pair is because I though I lost the black pair! These are the most comfortable over-head wireless headphones I own to date. These are also the only pair with the greatest bluetooth range that is stable and works with the samsung ultra since a headphone jack is no longer built in. With the exception of a little swelling on the interior portion of the headband -probably from heat and my hot head when mowing the lawn, the headband and earpads portion appear in like-new condition with no fading, peeling or discoloration, and no change in comfort level. I‚Äôm guessing the large oval earcup shape has much to do with the comfort since the feel & cushioning is more natural. I have found them comfortable for long sessions of 6+ hours and after having fallen asleep wearing them on several occasions. The headphones not only survived my tossing and turning through the night without cracks or breaking but my ears had no pressure soreness the next morning! They are definitely durable and work well indoors as well as outdoors. I use the headphones when at home listening to music, watching tv, movies, podcasts etc. I also wear them listening to music when outdoors mowing!  Other stuff:- Battery life & charging. Charging takes about 2 hours. I‚Äôve never timed it so can‚Äôt say for sure. All I can say is a full charge can last a couple weeks between charges depending on your use (65 hours)!!!- Pairing & Bluetooth. The bluetooth range is reported as 33 feet but I swear the connection on this device allows me to go further than on my other devices which usually is as far as the laundry room before out of range/disconnecting. This pair allows for past the laundry room, onto the back patio, into the yard and almost into the back lot with a connection that is stable and reliable. I can actually mow the lawn leaving my phone in the house. The connection is immediate once pairing is established (‚ÄúWH2037A‚Äù). It works with all bluetooth devices.-Answering Calls & microphone. In all my years of owning the headphones, I never had them on when a call came in until last week. I couldn‚Äôt find the phone, so I took a chance and hit the button to take the call and knock-on-wood it wasn‚Äôt a telemarketer! My friend came in clear and crisp, and was advised that my voice was likewise, meaning a pretty good microphone is built-in to handle calls. I was able to talk and walk and not lose the connection while searching for my phone.-Noise cancelling. It wasn‚Äôt a consideration or deal breaker for me. The headphones are not ‚Äúnoise cancelling‚Äù so don‚Äôt expect to ‚Äútune out‚Äù your barking dog or TV. On the other hand, anyone sitting close to you will not be bothered by your music, so I guess it does provide some noise blocking.-Sound Quality. It‚Äôs exceptional for the price point! I have found music, vocals and speech to come in clear with a nice balance. They are great for casual listening, and use with non-professional video mixing/editing software projects. The headset comes with 6 EQ modes to deliver a more personal experience.Overall, I am pleased with my purchase. As they say, you get what you pay for. For once, I can honestly say you‚Äôre getting a better value for the price which just doesn‚Äôt happen much anymore. These are a great price, exceptional value, portable, durable, comfortable, and excellent sound quality for the casual listener at a price that‚Äôs hard to beat. 5 stars!Read more"
"Wireless Earbuds, Bluetooth 5.4 Headphones, True Wireless Stereo Earphones with IPX7 Waterproof, Noise Cancelling Mic, Fast Charging and Comfort Fit Ear Buds for Sports/Workouts - Black",$16.99,4.9 out of 5 stars,"1,389","I  gave these wireless headphones from the Trausi brand to my cousin because he needed new ones to use both in the gym and at home, and the truth is that they were perfect for him. He told me that the Bluetooth 5.4 connection is very stable and fast, and that the sound is clear, with good bass and no interference.He also really liked that they are water resistant (IPX7), since he sweats a lot while exercising and does not have to worry about damaging them. The battery lasts a long time and the charging case is practical. From what he told me, they are comfortable to wear for a long time.Read more"
"Soundcore by Anker Q20i Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Headphones, Wireless Over-Ear Bluetooth, 40H Long ANC Playtime, Hi-Res Audio, Big Bass, Customize via an App, Transparency Mode (White)",$47.49,4.6 out of 5 stars,"32,021","When both my Bose Quiet Comfort and backup JBL Live 660NC headphones bit the dust within 2 weeks of each other, I was in search of an acceptable replacement over-ear noise-cancelling headphones without spending hundreds of dollars. I admit that ultimately I plan to buy Bose again, but in the meantime until I can stomach spending $300-400 on a set of headphones I purchased a KVIDIO noise-cancelling over-ear model for I think $20, I wanted to see if you can get tolerable quality sound from such an affordable headphone set. Long story short: no, you can't. At least not with the specific set I purchased from KVIDIO. The sound was very tinny and lacked depth, and I had to increase the volume to almost maximum in order to hear any kind of detail at all. The noise-cancelling works okay on the model, but NC functionality is worthless to me if the sound produced by the headphones is just straight up not good at all. I'm happy to report that the Soundcore by Anker Q20i produces very decent sound, the noise-cancelling function is actually better than my older JBL headphones that cost a lot more when I bought them new, and are as comfortable as any over-ear headphones can be. I haven't adjusted the EQ settings via the app yet, so cannot comment on whether this is just a gimmick or whether a significant adjustment to bass, treble, etc. can actually be produced by changing settings in the app. But if you are looking for a good over-ear set of headphones with adequate noise-cancelling capability without spending hundreds of dollars, this is definitely the set you should buy. Additionally, because my other headphones that I purchased years ago had multi-device connectivity, I think I took for granted that some headphones are unable to connect to more than 1 device at a time, and switching between my laptop and my phone for audio was impossible with the aforementioned $20 model. I constantly switch between my laptop, phone, and tv when using headphones, especially if it's evening time and I don't want to disturb my neighbors with loud music or my TV playing. These do allow multiple device connection, and that is an absolutely necessary function for me personally. I didn't even know this was not a standard function until I bought a very cheap pair of headphones. For your sanity, do not make my same mistake, just get these. The irritation of disconnecting from one device to connect with another multiple times daily to just use the headphones on either my phone or my laptop drives me up a wall, and I will never select any headphones or earbuds from now on that do not allow multiple devices to be connected to it. Just a word of warning if you're as impatient as me when it comes to device functionality and use.Read more"
"Wireless Earbuds Bluetooth 5.3 Headphones HiFi Stereo, Wireless Earphones with Noise Cancelling Mic, 50H Playback Ear Buds with LED Digital Display for iOS/Andriod - White",$9.99,5.0 out of 5 stars,"1,035","Alright so listen. I bought these Beniduck wireless earbuds mostly cuz the name made me giggle. Beniduck? Sounds like a cartoon detective who solves music crimes. But lemme tell you, these lil nuggets of audio glory are the real deal. First off, they paired with my phone faster than I pair socks on laundry day (which is sayin a lot). Like, I blinked and boom connected. And the sound? Crispy. Clear. Bass that goes ‚Äúthump‚Äù just enough to make you feel cool even if you‚Äôre just listening to grocery store jams while washing dishes. The fit is snug but not ‚Äúmy ears are being held hostage‚Äù tight. I did a whole interpretive dance routine in my living room and they didn‚Äôt even budge. Even when I sneezed mid spin. That‚Äôs dedication. The noise canceling mic is wild too. I took a call while standing next to a blender and my friend legit thought I was in a quiet caf√©. It‚Äôs like these earbuds whispered ‚Äúshhh‚Äù to the chaos around me. Also the LED display makes me feel like I‚Äôm holding a tiny piece of spaceship tech. Shows the battery and everything. Real futuristic vibes. Oh and the battery life? I swear these things just don‚Äôt die. I‚Äôve charged them once and I‚Äôve already gone through like 27 mood playlists, two voice memos of me singing poorly, and five very dramatic FaceTime rants. Still goin strong. Bottom line, they‚Äôre comfy, sound great, look fancy, and make you feel like your head is a concert hall with excellent acoustics. Would I buy again? Absolutely. Beniduck may sound goofy, but these earbuds are serious business. Get ‚Äòem. Dance in your kitchen. Become the audio legend you were meant to be.Read more"
"Soundcore P30i by Anker Noise Cancelling Earbuds, Strong and Smart Noise Cancelling, Powerful Bass, 45H Playtime, 2-in-1 Case and Phone Stand, IP54, Wireless Earbuds, Bluetooth 5.4 (Green)",$23.74,4.4 out of 5 stars,"9,125","These earbuds are amazing for the price (make sure to check the coupon checkbox to get them for $30)! Here are some pros and cons to keep things simple:Pros- The sound quality is very good, with punchy bass and solid quality all-around. I‚Äôm not an audiophile by any means, but these sound great to me. I did use the ‚Äúbass reducer‚Äù profile in the app, though, because the default profile‚Äôs bass level was actually a bit too much for me.- Multipoint connectivity! If you didn‚Äôt know, this feature enables an audio device to connect to two devices via Bluetooth at the same time, so you can seamlessly switch between listening on two separate devices if the earbuds are connected to both. This is a total game changer for me, as I can use them on my phone when I‚Äôm away from my computer, walk up to my computer, and then play something on there without having to manually disconnect them from my phone and connect them to my computer. You can enable this feature in the Soundcore app by going to the Soundcore P30i settings, pressing the gear icon, and enabling ‚ÄúDual Connections‚Äù.- Excellent battery life. These are advertised as lasting 10 hours on a charge without ANC on, and I usually got about 8 hours, which is still very good. They also charge super quickly in the case. ANC drops your battery life, but the advertised 6 hours on a charge with ANC is still solid.- Active noise cancelling (ANC). Seriously, how did they manage to include this on $30 earbuds, and what‚Äôs more, how is it so good?!? I have a hearing condition called misophonia that makes me sensitive to certain sounds like gas-powered leaf blowers, and I‚Äôm also autistic and sensitive to noise, and the ANC capability on these earbuds has completely changed my life for the better because it enables me to block out lawn care noise, plane noise, traffic noise, and so on, or at least greatly reduce their intensity. I can‚Äôt express how happy these earbuds make me in my day-to-day life due to knowing I have an easy solution in my pocket to any triggering noise.- The case looks and feels nice, and the earbuds stick back into their positions on the charging prongs within it with a nice click.- The Soundcore app is incredible. You can set premade EQ presets or create your own, tweak various earbud settings, remap the single tap, double tap, triple tap and tap and hold actions for the touchpads, and so much more. Everything just works and the UI is nice.Cons (all pretty minor things that I figured I‚Äôd still mention):- The fit isn‚Äôt the greatest, and they get loose sometimes when I‚Äôm eating or doing anything else involving a lot of jaw movement. They‚Äôre easy to readjust, though, and they‚Äôve never outright fallen out of my ears, not even during bumpy bike rides.- There‚Äôs a slight delay between when you execute a single tap on the touchpad and when something happens. I suspect this may be because after a single tap, the earbuds are waiting to see if you‚Äôll tap one or two more times for a double or triple tap respectively, which is understandable, but it‚Äôs still a bit annoying sometimes, considering my Samsung Galaxy Buds + didn‚Äôt do this.- My left ear gets very slightly sore after having them in for 5+ hours. It‚Äôs not bad at all, and that‚Äôs longer than I use them in a single session most of the time, but I figured I‚Äôd mention it anyway. And yes, I did try all the eartip sizes and still had this problem.- The stem design means you can‚Äôt sleep with these in if you‚Äôre a side sleeper like me and wanted to use them for that. I‚Äôd recommend something with a wingtip design like the Galaxy Buds + instead if you want a good pair of sleep buds.- They take a while to connect to your devices sometimes.- They only report their battery percentages to whichever device you‚Äôre connected to in 10% increments. It‚Äôd be nice to be able to see the battery percentage to the nearest 1% like with the Galaxy Buds +.- You can‚Äôt see how much battery the case has remaining until the light strip on the front flashes when you put the earbuds in.- The light bar on the case flashes green when the case is charging. This may be a problem for you if you like to charge your earbuds at night, but honestly, the battery life of both the buds themselves and the case is so good that you probably won‚Äôt need to do that. You could also cover it up with a sock or something overnight to block the light.Overall, I highly recommend these earbuds to anyone and everyone, and have already recommended them to a friend, a coworker, and a family member. I even bought two pairs, one for work and one for home use, they‚Äôre that good!Read more"

I've had earbuds that made my head and brain feel like they were vibrating, I'm not a fan of that feeling really, so I love that these ones don't do that but have the great bass still. I love the fact that they have a button so that just a small tap won't pause or change anything when you don't want it to. even for phone calls, YouTube videos, and tiktok these are great! mine came in with a battery charge of 100% as well, so you should be able to use them right away. the purple pair that had gotten stolen had come in with a 97% charge, too. they do come with a charger but no USB block, which I don't feel like it's an issue. I'm sure we all have a block for that laying around or we could use a desktop or laptop to charge them. the color is very pretty, too! i was expecting more of a purple tone to it since I ordered purple blue this time, but they're more blue. still gorgeous! I'm definitely going to be ordering more, though. i want the light green ones, too! I love all the different color options! and they're all such pretty colors. the purple ones were so bright, I do miss those ones! but I adore these ones for sure! the little screens in the case have never never lagged for me, either. you'll see when the charge is decreasing and it does alert you when it's low immediately. the screen on the right does show what is pictured and will let you know if they're unevenly charged, which sometimes I only use one earbud, so that's great to know septhow much of a charge they have. they're definitely worth the price and I do recommend them! packaging is safe and secure for them as well! there is a film to pull off that protects the case when you unbox it as well. and they do come with a little bag of rubber ear pieces of different sizes, which is also awesome! i believe there's 2-3 different sized ones in the little bag. soooo 10/10 definitely recommend!Read more"

NOW, for Amazon you guys really need to improve your service in regards to handling matters such as mine. First, the investigation I'm fine with and understand perfectly it needs to get done to prevent fraud from consumers. Talking with the first person when I called I wanted to make sure about the investigation process being done because it was a simple one at that. All that had to be done was see the time that the delivery label was printed shortly before that time you would clearly be able to see the person packing my items, and see only 3 out of the 4 items were placed in the box. Case closed! I do not appreciate having to call to check on the status and everything agents were rude and could not answer simple questions I still had about the investigation process. Now, after 4 days I called again to see the status of the investigation, for the operator to say we are issuing a refund. Why, did I not get a phone call or email letting me know about the result. Why is it me having to take time out of my day again to find out the status for a mistake your company clearly did while shipping my items. All, I was asking for is basic customer service admitting you were wrong and the very least an apology. I do not appreciate having to waste my time after not receiving an item I purchased having to go through this type of treatment. I really do not appreciate as if I was wrong and trying to commit fraud making a false claim. If this is the type of service that is consistently given, I will in the future spend more money and give my business to a company that shows appreciation.Read more"

"Y01 Wireless Over Ear Headphones, Noise Canceling Bluetooth 5.3 Headphones with Microphones,Hi-Res Audio,48H Playtime,Foldable,Breathable Soft Earpads for iOS/Android/Samsung/PC-Pink",$39.90,4.2 out of 5 stars,424,"Despite the fact that I spend a significant amount of time traveling between busy trains, bustling coffee shops, and home offices, I had the distinct impression that I was immersed in a pristine and immersive audio environment the instant I turned on my headphones. Following a period of many weeks during which I used these headphones on a regular basis, I am really delighted by the way in which they have improved both my work calls and my music breaks. Instantaneously, the noise-cancelling function completely altered the atmosphere in my surroundings. In past headsets, I would constantly be distracted by background noise, such as the drone of an airline cabin or a distant conversation, which would cause me to lose concentration. But with them, the world in the background disappeared nearly totally, which made it possible for me to focus on presentations or deadlines without being interrupted. The same quality made movie evenings seem like they were in a theater, replete with deep bass pulses and precise highs that highlighted every aspect of the music. In addition to being very airy and silky, the earpads conform themselves to my ears in a gentle manner without being too constrictive. During the days when I wore them for eight-hour editing sessions or flights that lasted six hours, I did not experience any discomfort or overheating. I was able to avoid experiencing the exhaustion and discomfort that I had previously experienced because the headband that I wore was adjustable and distributed weight equally over the crown of my head. Even at the end of the day, taking them off seemed more like waking up from a restful slumber than it did like removing an item that was not something that was wanted.Read more"

"Apple AirPods Pro 2 Wireless Earbuds, Active Noise Cancellation, Hearing Aid Feature, Bluetooth Headphones, Transparency, Personalized Spatial Audio, High-Fidelity Sound, H2 Chip, USB-C Charging",,4.6 out of 5 stars,"31,007","WAY LONG REVIEW, BUT ABOUT SOMETHING IMPORTANT, SO‚Ä¶TL;DR: Apple AirPods Pro 2s actually help ‚Äúturn down the volume‚Äù of my life-long tinnitus. YMMV‚Ä¶So, for those of us crusty old codgers with beat up ears, here's an interesting discovery I made today:I (unsurprisingly) listen to a lot of stuff while working out in my shop. And as a DOACA (""Dude of a Certain Age"") who worked as a roadie & stage tech in the age of Grunge, I have pretty pronounced tinnitus, so I'm doubly careful about my hearing when using some of my larger shop tools, like my cabinet saw, mill, etc, which means I'm often putting hearing protection on, and taking it off repeatedly. I have a decent ""bone conduction"" headset that allows for environmental awareness, but the protectors don't work with those on. I have tried a few wireless earbuds (most recently the well reviewed certain-Lab ‚ÄúMini‚Äùs) but there was some problem or other with all of them (the Minis sound great, but have terrible connectivity).So I finally sucked it up and got a set of Apple AirPod Pro 2s (yeah, mostly after hearing Adam Savage rave about them in a recent video you can easily find.) An interesting thing about them is that Apple actually worked with the US FDA (for those of you not in America, that's the federal agency that regulates medical devices here in the States‚Äîyou need to be certified by them to make any medical claims about a product or device) and got these to be certified as Class II hearing aids in the US and Canada. And in addition to a clinical-grade hearing test feature included that runs in the app, the Hearing Aid feature is easy to employ, and actually useful. But that's not what has me so jazzed about these.Aside from the Bluetooth being rather astounding (my wife took my phone to the other end of the house about 40' away, with our chimney stack between us, and stuck it in her sock drawer‚Äîtotally fine), the noise cancellation is *shockingly* good. And this is where things get interesting, and where we get back around to my tinnitus.Putting these in my ears this morning while sitting in my dining area, next to our furnace closet with the HVAC running, the ANC immediately kicked in. And even with no music or sound playing, the furnace noise (I'd guess about ~50dB) just... *disappeared*. I literally had to take them out and put them back in a few times to see if I was going a bit bonkers. But not only did that sound disappear, but my tinnitus‚Äîa group of between five and seven tones of various frequencies between 4kHz - 8/9kHz that has a perceived volume of about 40dB all the time‚Äîsuddenly had its volume ""turned down"" by about 10-15dB.It was rather startling.I've heard those tones from the age of 17 on (I'm now 57). Incessantly. Unforgivingly. Perpetually.For them to get quieter was pretty amazing.I suspect that the Active Noise Cancellation is at play here. If you're not aware, AirPods have microphones built into them. The main, obvious ones, are the little sticks that come off them outside your ears that listen to the environment around them. But there is a second set of microphones that detect the sounds *inside your ear canal when the buds are in them* that are likely the heroes here. The buds take both of those sound profiles (technically, it's *four* sound signatures‚Äîtwo for each ear) and then uses machine learning combined with Apple's H2 chip to create ""anti-noise.""Now, anti-noise is nothing new: I mean, *that's how ANC works*. It's also nothing new to tinnitus sufferers, either. ""Noise generators"" have been around for decades. There are even apps available that allow you to pump white, gray, pink, brown, or other noise ""colors,"" or other environmental sounds (ocean waves, rain, fireplace crackling, etc) into your ears -via- buds throughout the day to ""mask"" tinnitus. Many people have decent luck with this kind of tinnitus self-treatment‚ÄîI never have.I suspect that it's the inner microphones (Apple is one of a handful of current makers that have this) that are really helping to effectively mask the sound that gets past the bud seals, combined with (love 'em or hate 'em) Apple's crazy level of R&D that gets these buds to analyze not only the environmental noise profile *outside* the buds, but the sound that *gets past the buds*. This winds up being a broader noise profile, so the buds generate a broader palate of anti-noise, and then puts it *right in your ear*.Now to be clear, I can still hear my tinnitus tones. They're just less present in the... what? *""auditory mix""* in my head. But boy oh boy is the change noticeable. At least for now. It may be that in time my ears get used to the trick. But as of right now? I'm fine with being fooled.It may be that other buds with ANC also do this, but I can't speak to any other solutions except the comparison to my -Labs. I get nothing if you buy these or any other buds. This is just my experience, but as someone who's lived with this affliction for so long, ANY positive change is important enough for me to take time, write down, and share my experience. YMMV.If you have tinnitus, or hearing problems (or suspect you might) these are a serious consideration.Read more"

They still squeeze a bit, so depending on the glasses I'm wearing can hurt a little, but I'd say they're the first set of headphones I've really been able to wear for a long time.I think the audio quality is great for my not-very-serious enjoyment of music/tv/etc. and the microphone works pretty well (I'm audible when on calls, at least). I really appreciate the dual-connection functionality, as I switch between my phone and laptop often and I don't have to worry about it at all now. It connects easily and switches between both nicely. I dislike outside noise being totally cut out, so I appreciate that these headphones don't totally cancel outside noise (it's also comfortable for me to have one of my ears half-covered so I can hear things happening easier).I was a bit hesitant about buying these at first but I think they're well worth it!Read more"

"Soundcore Anker Life Q20 Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Headphones, Wireless Over Ear Bluetooth Headphones, 70H Playtime, Hi-Res Audio, Deep Bass, Memory Foam Ear Cups, Travel, Office, USB-C Charging",$37.99,4.4 out of 5 stars,"2,700","TL;DR: If you‚Äôre on a tight budget and are looking for high quality headphones that are great for every use imaginable, these are for you.I‚Äôve had these headphones for almost two months now, and I cannot stress enough how shocked I am at their quality for their price.For a bit of backstory, I‚Äôm a young person who lives alone and who generally has a fairly tight budget. I‚Äôve been wanting over the ear headphones for a long time, but couldn‚Äôt reconcile the cost of the big name brands like Sony, Beats, Apple, etc. I randomly decided to do a bit of market research to see if there were any good quality options in my price range (which, I‚Äôll admit, was very limited). After a long night of reading reviews and comparing prices, I decided to go with these headphones. I thought ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre under $50, so I‚Äôm sure they won‚Äôt be amazing quality, but they should do the trick for a couple years.‚ÄùAfter using these daily for two months, I cannot explain enough how impressed I am with the quality of these budget headphones. First off, the noise settings - the active noise cancelling is genuinely impressive. It does a better job than my in-ear Bose active noise cancelling headphones, which were 4 times the price. The bass setting is my preferred setting for music listening, as I‚Äôm someone who really enjoys physically feeling music when I listen to it. I‚Äôm not an audio expert by any means, but I am someone who cares a lot about music and my listening experience, and these headphones have bested every high-priced in ear headphone I‚Äôve ever used (Apple, Bose, Beats, etc.). You don‚Äôt have to turn the volume up very much to get some good depth in this setting, which is nice. It does dampen the noise cancelling a bit, but when you‚Äôre listening to music you really can‚Äôt notice at all. The transparency setting is really useful for when I use these at work, as I can stay tuned into a meeting but still be aware of my surroundings.Physically, they‚Äôre so comfortable that I forget I‚Äôm wearing them. The foam padding is very plush and soft, and the headphones don‚Äôt feel tight on my ears at all. One slight issue is the size adjustment, at their smallest size they‚Äôre still slightly too big for me, but that‚Äôs a very small issue that I only notice when reclined/exercising. They‚Äôre very lightweight as well, I never even notice it.They also are so amazingly easy to connect to multiple devices. I have these headphones connected to my laptop, phone, and TV at any given time, and they easily switch from one to the other automatically when needed. For example, I can have my headphones on watching TV (which is great, as I live in an apartment with thin walls and I have hearing issues), and if I watch a video on my phone, they will automatically switch to my phone, then switch back to my TV when I resume my show.They‚Äôre also so pretty?? I got the pink ones, and they have a beautiful pearlescent exterior that I just love. I get compliments on it all the time!!My only issues with these headphones are so exceptionally minor that they don‚Äôt even warrant any stars off. The first is the control system - I truly cannot figure out how to skip/replay songs. I know you‚Äôre SUPPOSED to be able to do it, but no matter what arrangement I seem to press the correct button it, it doesn‚Äôt do anything but pause/play. It‚Äôs possible this is my own user error, as I threw away the user manual and haven‚Äôt looked it up, so that‚Äôs on me lol.The other slight issue I have with them is that they don‚Äôt really come with much of a carrying case. They come with a drawstring bag, which was nice until I immediately lost it because it‚Äôs significantly harder to keep track of than an actual hard-sided case. They also don‚Äôt actually offer much protection for the headphones other than from scratches, so a hard-side case would be awesome. But honestly, those complaints are so minor and irrelevant that I genuinely do not care!!All in all, I cannot recommend these enough. They are scarily good for their price, demonstrating once again that the free market is a sham and brand recognition sells more than actual product quality!!!Read more"

"Sennheiser Consumer Audio RS 175 RF Wireless Headphone System, Black",$199.95,4.2 out of 5 stars,"8,081","First let me say that I suffer a serious hearing loss which makes it difficult to watch television with my wife because I have to have the volume up so loud and even then I can't hear everything.  I have had two sets of sennheiser RS 120's for a few years now and loved them.  My wife wanted to get me these for Christmas this year because they were apparently capable of surround sound. Now I'm not an audiophile but I will try to point out some pro's and con's here.The 175's are an over the ear fit as opposed to the 120's being an on the ear fit.  The 175's fit much tighter which is very nice when up and moving about yet the tight fit makes it difficult to hear when my wife is speaking to me during a show which she does quite often.  I'll let you decide if that's is a pro or a con.  The 120's were loose enough that I could hear her speak even though I still had to remove the headset to understand her.  The looseness had a downside though in that if I went to the fridge for a drink or snack and bent down the headset fell off.  Not so with the 175's.  Both sets have excellent sound reproduction even though the 120's are analog.  The 175's can be digital or analog which can be decided by a switch on the back of the transmitter.  You have the option of connecting to the sound source by optical cable or 3.5 jack which in my case required a y adapter converting to RCA jacks.  I was amazed to find that there is a very noticeable difference between digital and analog, digital being the best by far.  With the digital you don't hear any static or interference noises in non-dialog or silent spots.  At least I couldn't hear any and my wife said in her words ""this is fantastic"".sound with the 175's:You can switch between regular stereo, low SRS, and High SRS by clicking a button on the side of the headset.  This can also be controlled at the transmitter.  There is a very noticeable difference between each setting.  I have noticed that on low SRS the background recordings seem to be moved back and reduced in volume while the main dialog remains at regular volume.  Ever had one of those instances where the main character is talking in a whisper voice, which seems to be in vogue these days, and is suddenly overrun by the background noise, which also seems to be a problem these days.  Well, low SRS helps to overcome that problem for me.  I can hear the dialog very clearly and if you've lived for a while having to constantly asked ""what did he/she say?""  then you can really appreciate that fact.In High SRS there is a distinct surround sound quality.  I've never been able to experience this before due to my hearing loss so to me it is awesome.  I love Paul Simons music, especially ""Graceland"", ""father and daughter"" and ""late in the evening"".  I just thought I liked them before but after listening to them through the 175's I have heard notes and instruments that I didn't realize were there. Now I love the songs.  Having discovered that I went back and watched a couple of my favorite movies and discovered background sounds that I had been missing and they add so much more to the entertainment value.  Keep in mind that I have experienced all this with the 120's also and there is a large difference.continued pros sound aside:I like that the controls are on the side of the 175 headset because I often recline when watching television and this keeps the controls from contacting anything and changing the settings unintentionally.This was a problem with the 120 sets because the controls were behind the headset.The 175 set, to me, is much more comfortable because of the padding and because possibly of the tighter fit which keeps them in place verses the loose fit of the 120 set.cons (maybe):The 175 set is only capable of employing two headsets.The 120 can employ several at one time.  I'm not sure how many but certainly more than four because I have that many headsets.The 120 has an option of three channels selectable on the transmitter and the headset which means you can use more than one in a household without interfering with each other.  This is the situation at my house.  I have one set in the bedroom and one in the living room and we can use them separately on separate channels at the same time.  My grandkids love the headsets so this settles a problem when they come to visit and want cartoons while I want news.The 175 has only one channel so this setup would probably not be possible.The 175 power button has to be held down for about three seconds to activate while the 120 has a slide switch.  The 175 has a very slight delay between activation and transmitter connection.  The 120 is instant.  This caused a rather humorous incident early on.  My wife was watching a movie on Netflix and I picked up the headset, turned it on, placed it on my head and thought I was waiting on a connection when in reality I was in a very quite point in the movie just before an explosion and massive gunfire.  I was on my way to my recliner when all hell broke loose and it was so realistic I almost wet my pants and overran the recliner.  It was apparently the highlight of my wife's day.  She still laughs about it.  Her lack of concern about my bruised shins and ego aside...after the fact it was funny.I know this was lengthy but I hope it helps someone in my situation to make an informed decision.In  short I would never had purchased the 175's for myself due to the cost because I wouldn't have believed they would make this much difference.  Now that I've experienced them I would buy them in a heartbeat.Now a word about sennheiser's customer service.  I had a situation early on where I lost the optical connection with my TV.  I was quick to blame the new headset simply because they were new.  I sent an email to sennheiser  in hopes they could find a solution before I had to send the set back.  I had a return mail in about 45 minutes telling me what to do.  Turns out the problem was with the television and not the sennheiser transmitter.  Quick response, great customer service.Read more"

I bought these Beniduck wireless earbuds mostly cuz the name made me giggle. Beniduck? Sounds like a cartoon detective who solves music crimes.

Like, I blinked and boom connected. And the sound? Crispy. Clear. Bass that goes ‚Äúthump‚Äù just enough to make you feel cool even if you‚Äôre just listening to grocery store jams while washing dishes. The fit is snug but not ‚Äúmy ears are being held hostage‚Äù tight. I did a whole interpretive dance routine in my living room and they didn‚Äôt even budge. Even when I sneezed mid spin. That‚Äôs dedication. The noise canceling mic is wild too. I took a call while standing next to a blender and my friend legit thought I was in a quiet caf√©. It‚Äôs like these earbuds whispered ‚Äúshhh‚Äù to the chaos around me. Also the LED display makes me feel like I‚Äôm holding a tiny piece of spaceship tech. Shows the battery and everything.

I've had them for about two-three years now, and they still work just as great now as they did out of the box. The battery can last upwards of three days when kept on all day *and* all night, and the sound quality is amazing. They're incredibly comfortable, and extremely durable. The worst problem I've had is a slight crack in the plastic of the band- but the headphones have held great despite it- and I didn't even notice the crack for some time. They charge super fast, up to full within around 45 minutes- and I've only experienced slight connectivity issues (Though, I am almost certain this is my computer, and not the headphones!)100% worth the purchase, would probably buy fifty more- if these ones ever even break!Read more"
"JBL Vibe Beam - True Wireless JBL Deep Bass Sound Earbuds, Bluetooth 5.2, Water & Dust Resistant, Hands-free call with VoiceAware, Up to 32 hours of battery life (Black)",,4.3 out of 5 stars,"24,505","This review is about the audio features of the JBL Vibe Beam earbuds.I'm an audio engineer so audio quality is very important to me. As such, I use wired connections as much as possible to maintain the integrity of the audio signal.  However, many newer consumer-level products no longer have audio jacks, so I finally decided to invest in some wireless earbuds as a backup to the other earphones and headphones that I use.  I didn't want to spend a lot of money as I didn't foresee myself using this product very much, and since this is my first foray into wireless audio earphones, if they were just ok or they broke after a while, then I wouldn't feel too bad about the little money that I spent.  Also, I wanted to focus on finding wireless earbuds with excellent audio quality first as I already have an excellent high-end bluetooth earpiece for cell phone use, and I wouldn't be using this product as a bluetooth headset for my phone.After doing much research, I chose the JBL Vibe Beam's as they were at my price point, I'm familiar with JBL products, and I could reasonably expect that they were likely deliver the high audio quality that I've come to expect from JBL products.  In my research, I read reviews that complained about the harshness of the high end with high frequency instruments like cymbals or the lack of bass, so I was a bit concerned.When I received and started listening to my JBL Vibe Beams I understood what people were talking about.  However, to correct the issues, first, one must have a great fit of the earbuds in their ears.  I'm fortunate, in that with the medium tips that were already installed on the Vibe Beams, they made a snug fit in my ears right out of the box.  If you find that these earbuds do not fit well in your ears it might be worthwhile to invest in a separate set of variable sized earbud tips, or try tips from one of your other well-fitting earbuds, if you have them.  Once the earbuds were seated properly in my ear, that took care of the poor bass issue. (I have not worn them long-term so I can't speak to them falling out of my ear, as others have mentioned, but they seem to stay in pretty well.)For the misaligned frequency response issue, fortunately, the JBL Headphone app that you can install on your cell phone includes a ten-band graphic equalizer that you can use to make adjustments to the frequency response of your earbuds.  After listening to several of the reference tracks I use to check new audio equipment or my mixes against, I found that the only adjustments needed were carving out some of the upper midrange and making a very slight boost in the bottom end of the lower frequency spectrum.  I've included a screenshot of my EQ curve which I based on the Bass preset in the JBL app.  You can't tell as there is no dB scale on the side, but I needed to cut or boost by only 1-2 dB.  I find that my new EQ curve gives a more balanced frequency response than what came out of the box, and matches up well against the reference speaker system and headphones that I use for my audio mixing and mastering work.  I invite you to use my EQ curve as a starting point and adjust as sounds best to you.I also read reviews complaining about the apparent lack of volume of the Vibe Beams.  I connected the JBL's to several different sources (phone, computer, TV, MP3 player, etc.) and I found that the overall maximum volume (with limiter off) is relatively lower than wired speaker versions.  However, the input to the JBL's is relative to the maximum output of the source itself.  I found that the loudest level I could get came from my iPhone and the lowest level output came from my MP3 player (which probably doesn't offer much output anyway being a tiny portable unit).  As a comparison, I did a side-by-side test of the JBL's with my wife's AirPods (2nd gen).  What I found was that the JBL's offered an almost identical audio output level as the AirPods with any of the sources I used so that confirmed that the output level of the JBL's has more to do with the source (and the source material as some songs are mastered at a lower volume than other songs) than with the earbuds themselves.  During my test, I put the JBL's at their maximum volume output (one tap at a time on the left bud to raise the volume).  Also, I noticed during my testing that the AirPods had a pleasing midrange sound perfect for listening to podcasts or watching video, but the JBL's excelled at full-range sound on the bottom and top ends of the frequency spectrum which made them sound much better over all and well-suited for music or listening to explosive action scenes in movies.And speaking of movies, the JBL app has a switchable audio/video mode.  The video mode reduces the latency of the delivery of audio against picture, so there isn't a noticeable lip-sync issue with dialogue in a scene.  However, there is a slight degradation in the audio quality of 'video' mode versus 'audio' mode, but you will have to make the determination if the change in audio quality is acceptable to you.As a side note, I included a picture of the inner side of the earbuds.  The 'L' and 'R' designations on the earbuds are tiny as you can see, plus they are the same color as the earbuds themselves, so they are very hard to see.  I wish JBL had made the L/R letters bigger or at least made them a different color so they would be easier to see.The pairing process was fairly easy with all my bluetooth-capable devices and the range was good, only dropping out after walking approximately 60-70 feet from the source.  There was one momentary dropout during my listening but that could be due to my wife using her AirPods the same time as I was using the JBL's.I can't speak to the other features of the JBL Vibe Beams as I don't intend to use them, but as far as audio quality goes, with just a few minor tweaks, these bluetooth earbuds can go from sounding like a $50 pair of earbuds to a $500 pair of reference earphones.Read more"

"LEVN Wireless Headphones for TV Watching, TV Headphones Wireless for Seniors with Transmitter Charging Base, Hearing-impaired, No Audio Delay Blutooth 5.2, Plug and Play, Gifts for Elderly",$69.97,4.4 out of 5 stars,"1,345","I was surprised to see only a 4.4 rating on these headphones. I had bought a pair for my wife some months ago, and I liked them so much I hinted to her to order me the headphones for Father's Day. These headphones deliver a clear, crisp sound. My other headphone had distortion at certain frequencies...These have no distortion throughout (my) hearing range, which makes them perfect for listening to music. A few reviewers stated that they aren't loud enough. I suggest it could be a problem with the audio settings on their TV, because when using the optical output on my TV, I find that max volume is too loud. It is even louder when I pair it to my cellphone, and would most likely result in hearing loss if listened to for an extended period.Another feature I like is that the headphones ""pair"" automatically to the base when you turn them on, and have never failed to connect. Of course, if you want to ""pair"" them to your cellphone, you must do the Bluetooth connectivity in your phone's settings (after ending the base connection by turning the base off), just as you would any other device.For the money, these are a great product. I only manage to rate items I really like, or really hate on Amazon. These headphones are a firm ""like"".Read more"
"SHOKZ OpenMove - Open-Ear Bluetooth Sport Headphones, Bone Conduction Wireless Earphones, Sweatproof for Running and Workouts, with Sticker Pack, Grey",,4.4 out of 5 stars,"20,136","I use headphones for outdoor running. Before I bought these, I was buying a new pair of wireless headphones every 6-9 months. I assumed this was just the expected mileage for headphones that suffer varied temperatures (25-80¬∞ is my running temperature range) and rain or snow. I am not particularly careful with them and often leave them in the car when the resulting temperature fluctuations inherent to northeast Ohio. ¬†Despite all of my lack of care, these headphones are starting their third year, and going strong. The sound is fine. I can hear my podcasts or music well enough with the sound turned down and I can still hear people or animals around. The battery life is still robust- I use them a lot and still charge them at most every 5 days. I dope them. My wife sat on them I. The car yesterday. I fall asleep with them on sometimes. Not seems to bother them. I just discovered that the left headphone had a little pause/play button that can be clicked without accessing the phone. Excellent product and well worth the money over the cheaper versions I have bought in the past.Read more"
"soundcore Life Q30 by Anker, Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Headphones with Multiple Modes, Hi-Res Sound, Custom EQ via App, 50H Playtime, Comfortable Fit, Bluetooth, Multipoint Connection",$55.99,4.4 out of 5 stars,"84,310","When I first received these I would have easily given them 5 stars. But after using them for a few months I've realized they only seemed amazing because I was coming from the $28 BT earbuds I was using daily. Now that I've had time to REALLY put them through the paces they're a lot more ""meh"" than I would have initially thought.The noise cancellation is mediocre at best as I've heard FAR better NC than this. There's still a TON of noise that gets through that should be silenced in full NC mode. The second setting is OK if you WANT to hear things around you better, but the 3rd setting is so laughably useless because it AMPLIFIES all the background noise so it's stupidly louder than if you weren't wearing the headphones at all. If you're buying these for noise cancellation stop right now and go look at some Bose. You'll pay a lot more, but they're worth it if NC is what you're chasing.Then when it comes to sound quality of course they blew my cheap BT earbuds out of the water, but after I took a minute to dig out my Sennheiser studio headphones that I rarely use because I don't want to deal with wires in 2025, I realized these sound poor in comparison. Not bad, but far from audiophile. The frequency response of these must look like a slide going down towards the high end because the bass is OK but the highs are way too weak to even hint at being ""audiophile"" quality. It sounds like you're listening to a nice stereo that's in the other room when it comes to clarity. Seriously you rap fans need to stop glazing crap headphones because they have half decent bass. The more I listened to music with them the more disappointed I became.But the biggest issue I have is how tight they are. I only wear a 7 1/2 hat. I'm dead center of what's ""average"" for an adult male. If I wear these for longer than an hour while working it starts to give me a headache because it feels like my head is in a vice. That's great if you're working out but horrible if you're sitting at a desk all day. Another issue I have is I'll randomly get the ""connected"" chime while I'm using them when they never disconnected. Something I've never experienced with 4 other BT headphones on my PC. Not a big deal but an annoying bug nonetheless. Then the earpads I have zero doubt will be shredded within a year. The material covering them is way too thin an cheap. For this price range they should be using a quality vinyl or PV fake leather. Not this tissue thin vinyl. Again, not terrible, but not ideal.But don't think it's all bad. I'm nitpicking here so anyone reading knows what to truly expect. Where they DO shine is battery life. These last stupidly long which has been really nice when my previous earbuds were lucky to last 4hrs. You can go DAYS without recharging them. Not to mention I'm looking at these compared to REAL headphones so I'm going to be extra picky but I'll be fair overall.Value = 4/5 They are pretty affordable, but it feels like they cheaped out by not giving you a measly $4 3.5mm cable for $90 headphones. I'd also like to see more money put into the earpads. Edit: now with a 20% coupon they're a strong buy.Sound quality/frequency response = 3/5 Great if you only listen to rap music, garbage if you're an audiophile. But acceptable for the price.Build quality = 3/5 Good on the plastics, but the earpads themselves are already getting creases that tells me they're going to crack soon and I'll be buying replacements. Probably won't effect you if you use them once in a while, but if you're the kind of person that doesn't leave the house without your headphones these are going to look shabby.Noise cancellation = 3/5 It works, but I've heard far better and the 3rd setting is completely unusable. For the price it's acceptable as there's far better out there, but often for far more money.Comfort = 2/5 Headache unless you have a child's head. My wife likes them though. This is the frustration that got me to pull up the sale and write a review. I wish I could figure out a way to stretch them out or something.Battery life = 7/5 This is my review, I make up the ratings rules.I almost want to give these a 4/5 because for the price they're actually pretty competent headphones and by no means feel like cheap crap. But at the same time I'm literally wearing them right now and I'm already getting a headache. If you took that part out they'd be an easy 4 stars all day, but it's hard to think of the good stuff when a product literally hurts you.>>>Five Star Edit: Anker contacted me over this review which I felt wasn't even that negative to begin with. The offered me a full refund while never once mentioning anything about changing my review. THAT'S customer service that should be rewarded. If a customer isn't happy then see what it takes to make them happy. They never once asked how long I'd had them or tried to walk me through a help file that would never solve the issues like too many companies do today. They just wanted to make it RIGHT.I miss companies that stand behind their products. I've bought at least a dozen Anker products over the years between headphones, BT speakers, multiple USB power bricks and wall warts, and battery packs. They make excellent battery packs and I think mine is at least 10yrs old and still kicking like a tank. üòú This just makes me want to look to Anker first when I'm looking at gadget accessories and why I chose these headphones in the first place. I finally found one of their products I didn't love and Anker STILL did me right. Thank You Anker. This is how you run a company.Read more"
"Soundcore by Anker P20i True Wireless Earbuds, 10mm Drivers with Big Bass, Bluetooth 5.3, 30H Long Playtime, Water-Resistant, 2 Mics for AI Clear Calls, 22 Preset EQs, Customization (White)",$18.99,4.4 out of 5 stars,"66,049","Original review (two updates below - TL/DR, these are phenomenal for the price, along with Anker customer service!):Ok, first of all, I don't buy expensive earbuds. Never have, never will. I like good sounding music but I'm not an audiophile, I have kids and dogs, I travel for work occasionally, things get lost, etc. I've been using Boltune BT-BH020's for the last several years with a lot of success. Good sound quality, nice little magnetic case, USB-C charging, etc. My wife and I both have 2 pairs each, and they were about $35 a pair the last time we bought some. One pair finally crapped out on me so I went to order another set, and unfortunately they no longer exist. Not surprising considering the lifespan of cheaper Chinese brands on Amazon, but I was still a little disappointed.I liked the form factor of the Boltune case so I started looking for similar options, and landed on the Anker Soundcore P20i. I have always had good luck with Anker chargers and accessories in the past, so I was expecting a good, simple set of earbuds for $20, but nothing fancy. I tell you what though, I'm pretty blown away with what you get with these - easily the best ""budget"" level earbuds I've ever used.Packaging is typical Anker - excellent. Well put together, well protected. The earbud case itself is just slightly smaller than my old Boltune cases, but it comes with an attached lanyard, and has a notched area in the front for ease of opening - something that Boltune never got quite right (opening those cases was always a PITA, especially in the dark). Operation is simple - open the case and the earbuds power on (they will automatically go into device pairing mode if they haven't been paired yet). Return the earbuds to the case and close it to power them down and recharge. A couple additional sets of different sized earbud inserts are included so you can find the size that works best for your ears, as well as a 6"" USB-C charging cable and a well written instruction manual. Of note, Anker placed plastic covers over the charging prongs to keep them from being damaged in shipping or powering on accidentally and draining the batteries - a nice touch. The case battery was almost fully charged upon arrival and only took about 10 minutes to top off, and the earbuds showed 100% via the app right out of the box (more on the app in a second).Once paired, the sound quality is fantastic, especially at this price point. They easily outperform my other earbuds, especially in the low end. Mids and highs are crisp without being screechy or piercing. I can't really comment on bluetooth range as my phone is usually in my pocket while I'm mowing the lawn or working in the garage, so I've never really needed to test that aspect. Battery life is advertised as 10 hours on the earbuds alone without charging them at all, and 30 hours if you return them to the case to recharge between uses. I haven't had to recharge the case yet so I can't confirm that, but I have no reason to doubt that they'll work as advertised. They also say that ten minutes of charging will get you 2 hours of listening time, so these thing would be great for the airport even if you forgot to charge them beforehand and only have a few minutes between flights.What really sets these things apart though? The app! It is well designed, obviously created by native English-speaking developers, and is simple and intuitive to use. The first time I synced the earbuds to the app, I got an alert for a firmware update! I've NEVER had a cheap pair of earbuds that had that kind of support from the manufacturer - really awesome to see. Going beyond that, you can see the battery level for each earbud, configure the sound profile you prefer, turn on a bass boost if that's your thing, you can configure the left and right touchpads on the earbuds to do the function of your choice (answer, hang up, go forward one track, go back one track, etc) - and there's even a device locator that will play a loud high-pitched beep through the earbud of your choice if you accidentally drop one and can't find it. That feature alone is worth it's weight in gold - I can't tell you how many times I've dropped an earbud off of my nightstand and had to root around looking for the stupid thing, lol.All in all, I'm really impressed with these for the money. Hands down the best earbuds I've ever owned, and they are the cheapest so far! Well done, Anker!Also - I'm not a bot, not a shill, and nobody paid me to say this. Just a happy, human customer who's impressed with the product!Update 9/12/2024: Stellar customer service from Anker! If I could upgrade my review from 5 stars to 10, I would!So, randomly yesterday I was using my earbuds watching YouTube like I always do, and got a low battery notification. Plugged the case in and put the earbuds away to charge, and decided to get in the shower while they charged up. Came back out to resume watching my show, and for some reason only one earbud connected. Messed around with them for a while trying to get the second one to connect, and even though they both were powered on, I couldn't for the life of me get them to connect at the same time. I checked the paired device list on my phone and ended up noticing that each earbud was showing up as it's own individual device on my Bluetooth list, so my phone would only connect to one at a time. I couldn't get them to reset, unpairing and re-pairing made no difference, restarting my phone made no difference...something was wrong.I emailed Anker customer service, filled out the form on their website and provided a screenshot of my Amazon order, the order number, and the device serial number on the back of the case. They suggested some things to try (all of which I had already done), and when none of that worked, they apologized for the problems and agreed to replace my earbuds 100% free of charge! The rep said I should have a new pair within 5 business days. I got a shipping confirmation this morning...and guys, I had brand new set of earbuds this afternoon! Less than 24 hours after filing a ticket, they had replacements in my hands. That is absolutely STELLAR customer service for a $20 pair of earbuds! Now read the original review below, and order these with confidence. It's unfortunate that mine had such a random and wonky issue, but trust that Anker will take care of you if necessary. Thanks for reading!Update #2, 2/19/2025: Replacement pair is still going strong 9 months later! Zero issues at all, same amazing sound quality, zero degredation in audio or battery life. My wife actually texted me and said that she was trying to figure out what happened to Boltune, and came across a Reddit post mentioning this review!

You know the type with the wire between the two actual ear pieces.  I purchased these as an upgrade because I was tired of re-inserting one ear piece every time it popped out while walking, jogging, playing basketball, ect.  I purchased the Tozo earbuds solely on the product rating.  Little did I know how much sound I'd been missing.  I don't know if it was the fit or the upgraded electronics but these sounded so much better.  After months of use I took them on a trip and upon return thought I'd lost them, finding them weeks later as I prepared for another vacation.  They were obviously deep discharged and I had long since thrown away the instructions.  I reached out to Product Support on Amazon and the seller contacted me almost immediately.  They were incredibly responsive in resolving my issue.  If you are considering a brand on Amazon, look at the reviews as I did.  There are reasons for hundreds of thousands positive reviews and it's not just the excellent fit and sound quality but also for a team that takes care of their customers after the sale.Read more"

If youre hesitating because it's seems like a cheap brand, they are way better then you think. I bought an older version back in 2020 for 10 bucks and they were the best headphones ever. After running the charging case over with my lawn mower 5 years later, I was sad to see I couldn't find the exact one but a newer version. I was hesitant that maybe the first version was just lucky they were good, but these newer ones blow the old ones out of the water. Longer battery life on both the case and headphones themselves and the sound quality is actually crisp and clear. If youre hesitant to get these, don't be! You won't regret buying them.Read more"

I‚Äôve been wanting over the ear headphones for a long time, but couldn‚Äôt reconcile the cost of the big name brands like Sony, Beats, Apple, etc. I randomly decided to do a bit of market research to see if there were any good quality options in my price range (which, I‚Äôll admit, was very limited). After a long night of reading reviews and comparing prices, I decided to go with these headphones. I thought ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre under $50, so I‚Äôm sure they won‚Äôt be amazing quality, but they should do the trick for a couple years.‚ÄùAfter using these daily for two months, I cannot explain enough how impressed I am with the quality of these budget headphones. First off, the noise settings - the active noise cancelling is genuinely impressive. It does a better job than my in-ear Bose active noise cancelling headphones, which were 4 times the price. The bass setting is my preferred setting for music listening, as I‚Äôm someone who really enjoys physically feeling music when I listen to it. I‚Äôm not an audio expert by any means, but I am someone who cares a lot about music and my listening experience, and these headphones have bested every high-priced in ear headphone I‚Äôve ever used (Apple, Bose, Beats, etc.). You don‚Äôt have to turn the volume up very much to get some good depth in this setting, which is nice. It does dampen the noise cancelling a bit, but when you‚Äôre listening to music you really can‚Äôt notice at all. The transparency setting is really useful for when I use these at work, as I can stay tuned into a meeting but still be aware of my surroundings.Physically, they‚Äôre so comfortable that I forget I‚Äôm wearing them. The foam padding is very plush and soft, and the headphones don‚Äôt feel tight on my ears at all. One slight issue is the size adjustment, at their smallest size they‚Äôre still slightly too big for me, but that‚Äôs a very small issue that I only notice when reclined/exercising. They‚Äôre very lightweight as well, I never even notice it.They also are so amazingly easy to connect to multiple devices. I have these headphones connected to my laptop, phone, and TV at any given time, and they easily switch from one to the other automatically when needed. For example, I can have my headphones on watching TV (which is great, as I live in an apartment with thin walls and I have hearing issues), and if I watch a video on my phone, they will automatically switch to my phone, then switch back to my TV when I resume my show.They‚Äôre also so pretty?? I got the pink ones, and they have a beautiful pearlescent exterior that I just love. I get compliments on it all the time!!My only issues with these headphones are so exceptionally minor that they don‚Äôt even warrant any stars off. The first is the control system - I truly cannot figure out how to skip/replay songs. I know you‚Äôre SUPPOSED to be able to do it, but no matter what arrangement I seem to press the correct button it, it doesn‚Äôt do anything but pause/play. It‚Äôs possible this is my own user error, as I threw away the user manual and haven‚Äôt looked it up, so that‚Äôs on me lol.The other slight issue I have with them is that they don‚Äôt really come with much of a carrying case. They come with a drawstring bag, which was nice until I immediately lost it because it‚Äôs significantly harder to keep track of than an actual hard-sided case. They also don‚Äôt actually offer much protection for the headphones other than from scratches, so a hard-side case would be awesome. But honestly, those complaints are so minor and irrelevant that I genuinely do not care!!All in all, I cannot recommend these enough. They are scarily good for their price, demonstrating once again that the free market is a sham and brand recognition sells more than actual product quality!!!Read more"

I've had earbuds that made my head and brain feel like they were vibrating, I'm not a fan of that feeling really, so I love that these ones don't do that but have the great bass still. I love the fact that they have a button so that just a small tap won't pause or change anything when you don't want it to. even for phone calls, YouTube videos, and tiktok these are great! mine came in with a battery charge of 100% as well, so you should be able to use them right away. the purple pair that had gotten stolen had come in with a 97% charge, too. they do come with a charger but no USB block, which I don't feel like it's an issue. I'm sure we all have a block for that laying around or we could use a desktop or laptop to charge them. the color is very pretty, too! i was expecting more of a purple tone to it since I ordered purple blue this time, but they're more blue. still gorgeous! I'm definitely going to be ordering more, though. i want the light green ones, too! I love all the different color options! and they're all such pretty colors. the purple ones were so bright, I do miss those ones! but I adore these ones for sure! the little screens in the case have never never lagged for me, either. you'll see when the charge is decreasing and it does alert you when it's low immediately. the screen on the right does show what is pictured and will let you know if they're unevenly charged, which sometimes I only use one earbud, so that's great to know septhow much of a charge they have. they're definitely worth the price and I do recommend them! packaging is safe and secure for them as well! there is a film to pull off that protects the case when you unbox it as well. and they do come with a little bag of rubber ear pieces of different sizes, which is also awesome! i believe there's 2-3 different sized ones in the little bag. soooo 10/10 definitely recommend!Read more"

From the moment I unboxed them, I was impressed with the build quality and premium feel. The sound quality is outstanding‚Äîclear, rich, and full-bodied, with a deep bass that doesn‚Äôt overpower the mids and highs. Whether I'm listening to music, podcasts, or taking calls, the audio remains sharp and immersive, and the Hi-Res Audio certification really makes a difference for audiophiles. The Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) feature is a game changer. It effectively blocks out background noise, making it ideal for flights, office environments, or simply focusing at home. I especially appreciated the Transparency Mode, which allows ambient sound in when needed‚Äîgreat for staying aware while walking or working in shared spaces.Battery life is nothing short of amazing. The promised 70 hours of playtime is very real‚ÄîI‚Äôve gone over a week without charging, even with ANC enabled. It's incredibly convenient for long trips or busy weeks. The Bluetooth 5.4 connection is fast, stable, and has excellent range. Pairing is instant, and the connection stays solid even when I move between rooms. In terms of comfort, these headphones really deliver. The ear cups are soft and cushioned, perfect for wearing all day without discomfort. The adjustable headband ensures a snug fit, and the overall design is lightweight but durable.Read more"

"Skullcandy Hesh ANC Wireless Over-Ear Bluetooth Headphones with Charging Cable, Active Noise Cancelling, Up to 22 Hrs Battery, Foldable Lightweight Design, Microphone for iPhone Android - True Black",$75.99,4.4 out of 5 stars,"1,987","I've owned a pair of the Hesh ANC headphones for 2 years now and I love them. I'm a high school student and I use these headphones literally everyday, I'm not joking when I say that. These headphones have seen everything from hot, dry climates in the desert, humid tropical climates, concert mosh pits, numerous drops and falls, and frequent water splashes and spills. I highly recommend these headphones if you're looking for something reliable, comfortable, and functional.Like everything, this pair has pros and cons. I will discuss pros and cons first, and important notes afterward. I highly recommend reading the important notes section of this review as some things I mention may effect your decision on purchasing this product.Pros:These headphones feature very comfortable memory foam ear-cushions that are water resistant and fairly wear resistant as they have never failed to maintain their shape even after heavy use. The noise cancelling is very impressive in these headphones. I have used these headphones in environments with yard work equipment whirring, loudspeakers playing music, and airshows with loud aircraft overhead, and the noise cancelling does an excellent job. Do keep in mind that noise cancelling technology has it's limitations. These limitations include the inability to completely block out all noise (not 100% deafening), the inability to successfully suppress infrequent environment noises like speech, quick noises like pops or doors closing, furniture moving, etc.. With these limitations in mind, the noise cancelling ability of these headphones is very impressive in my opinion, as it very effectively blocks out lasting tones such as the bass in (loud) music, vehicles, etc..The swiveling sections of this device allow for a very compact form factor making stowage when packing very efficient and easy. Brands like Geekria provide excellent carrying and packing cases, I have one myself that I bring with me to my bag everyday to carry my headphones and charging equipment when necessary.The Hesh ANC user interface (button panel) may appear complicated at face value, however the many functions accessible via the UI is well worth the very present yet minor learning curve. These headphones have 3 ""noise cancelling"" modes. Mode 1: Noise cancelling off, standard listening mode (muffled outside environment due to your ears being covered). Mode 2: Noise cancelling on, your environment is muffled significantly. And Mode 3: Ambient Mode. The Ambient mode uses the microphones on the headphones used for noise cancelling to monitor the sounds in your environment, and play these detected sounds back to you through the speakers. In other words, your headphones magnifies your outside environment, which removes the muffling effect the headphones have when they are in standard listening mode. With ambient mode on, your music/audio plays at the same volume as the sounds around you are, respective to your volume preferences. This mode can be useful when talking or listening to others while still listening to your music/audio of choice.Cons:The stock cushions, though comfortable, did begin to fall apart after about a 1.5 years of use. However, the cushions are replaceable. I replaced my cushions with some made by WickedCushions, a company that makes headphone cushion replacements. I recommend keeping the stock cushions, and only replacing them if necessary.Important Notes:The power button (push and hold) takes 3 seconds to power on, and about 4-5 seconds to power off. Although this isn't long, it can be annoying at times since it isn't as quick as pushing a button once or flipping a switch.The noise cancelling mode, when on, produces a ""pressurized"" feeling to the user's ears. To those with sensory perception sensitivity, I would recommend keeping this in mind.Lastly, I've experienced a strange malfunction with these headphones only twice before. In these incidents, the headphones paused music, played a loud buzzing noise for about 10-20 seconds, and then power off. However, once powering them back on, everything is normal. I do not know if this was caused by low battery, or whether or not mine are perhaps slightly faulty, but I haven't experienced this frequently, as it's only happened twice in the 2 years of use.Despite the very few cons mentioned, I very highly recommend the Hesh ANC headphones. They have been incredibly reliable for the 2 years I've had them, and I have no intention in replacing them anytime soon.Read more"
"JLab Go Sport+ Wireless Workout Earbuds Featuring C3 Clear Calling, Secure Earhook Sport Design, 35+ Hour Bluetooth Playtime, and 3 EQ Sound Settings (Graphite)",$19.98,4.0 out of 5 stars,"22,652","Why did you pick this product vs others?:I‚Äôve purchased JLab headphones before. (I know these are probably supposed to be called earbuds but I use ‚Äòheadphones‚Äô and ‚Äòearbuds‚Äô interchangeably. Headphones/Earbuds = wireless headphones to me) They typically have lasted me a year (with everyday use for multiple hours a day). I wouldn‚Äôt say these are headphones that‚Äôll last you 10 years because they probably won‚Äôt, but if you‚Äôre being careful with them and not dropping them, letting them die, or using them 24/7 (like I did when I got my first pair in college)‚Äî they‚Äôll last a good while.Comfort:These are great when it comes to comfort. I‚Äôve worn my previous JLab earbuds for hours on end without discomfort or feeling like my ears are being squeezed. It‚Äôs been exactly the same with these, very comfy. Sound quality is also great! My music plays clearly and the volume is adjustable to be quiet, loud, or in-between. The little piece that goes around the ear isn‚Äôt tight or immovable, so it doesn‚Äôt pinch my ears; BUT it‚Äôs also not wiggly and useless, so it still helps secure the headphones. Also, bonus is that when I have my music on, I can barely hear outside sounds. The only thing that I‚Äôll really be able to hear is if someone is loudly saying something to me or if there‚Äôs a really loud sound nearby. This can be.. good or bad, depending on how much you want to ignore the rest of the world.Lightweight:Not much to say, they‚Äôre lightweight. Not heavy in the case, not heavy individually, the case isn‚Äôt massive, and they‚Äôre not some thick awful thing you have to force into your ears (like most earbuds are). They‚Äôre easy to carry in a pocket or bag, and easy to quickly pull out and use.Color:The color looks just like the picture and is beautiful!! I‚Äôll be real, I needed new headphones regardless‚Äî but the color choices really persuaded me to buy these asap, rather than saving money for a bit (which I‚Äôve been needing to do) and then getting them. I don‚Äôt know what color they called the ones I got, but they‚Äôre basically a beautiful bright coral color, you‚Äôll know which ones I‚Äôm talking about if you look at the different color options on the product. And yes, they really do look just like the picture.TLDR; they‚Äôre comfy, they‚Äôre gorgeous, they have good audio quality, and this brand of headphones/earbuds usually lasts at least a year (probably longer if you take better care of them than me).Read more"

I wanted to test across several price points to see which would be most worth the money. I've only had cheap running earphones before (though I have nicer cans that I use to listen with in other scenarios and some nice wired in ears for when I perform live). I don't really care about noise cancelling. My primary criteria were about comfort (and if it can stay in my ear while running), and the sound quality vs price (how much marginal return do I get per dollar). I ended up picking a premium pair because you can really notice how much more digital/fake the audio sounds when testing side by side, the lower down in price you go.(note: a lot of what I put were just notes I was jotting down while testing them. I try to do a more succinct summary in the first line of each option, and then it gets more rambly/random after that)In the running:Sony WF-1000XM4 $189.00 | Beats Fit Pro - $179 | Power Beats Pro - $179 | Jabra Elite 4 Active - $89 | JBL Endurance Peak 3 - $89.95 | Soundcore Sport X10 - $69.99 | JLab JBuds Air Sport - $69.88 | Golrex $29.99 | BMani  T16 $39.99Here are my thoughts:Power Beats Pro - $179 (149) - My winner overallSounds great. It is not the best sound I've heard in earphones, but doesn't seem to lack anything. Has good thumpy bass, presence in the mids, and good clarity up high. Nothing to complain about the sound.Big/heavy case (doesn't matter that much, but I do take these on big hikes so smaller case would have been nicer)I think ultimately will be more comfortable for long use than the Fit pro. The stock medium tips fit fine, unlike the fit pro for some reason.Sounds essentially the exact same as the fit pro which makes senseBeats Fit Pro - $179I wanted this to be my favorite. It's light, small, has fun color options, and sounds great. But it ultimately was just not comfortable enough to leave in my ears for longer than 45 minutes. This would vary from person to person obviously.Pretty comfortable, but had to switch to the small eartips (only earbuds I had to switch from the medium/stock tips). Stays in the ears well, but I think that the whole thing being in there will get uncomfortable pushing my ears after a while. Really little case which is nice.Really great clarity, feels perfectCan't find any eq in the app, but I didn't feel the need to adjust any eq settings either, every band/frequency was very satisfying, so that's kind of nice not having to set it myselfSony WF-1000XM4 $189.00I believe this has a slightly fuller sound quality to it. Can't really pinpoint how or why, but seems to be the most superior sound quality of all of them. I thought it might be better bass but that's not it. I can't pick a part any individual component that seem superior, it just has an overall fuller soundThere just doesn't seem to be any way that these are going to stay in during a run. Would be great for any non-exercise application, but just wasn't what I was looking for. I would choose these if I were looking for just walk around town kind of  earbuds.Jabra Elite 4 Active - $89Great clarity and bass out of the box. I am the kind of guy who can only really tell sound differences when a/b testing it. If I only listened to these earbuds, I would have been fully satisfied with the sound quality, the comfort, and the security. It's only because I tested it next to the premium models above that I decided not to go with this. But if this is your budget range, these are definitely the winners.Excessively comfortable, like the most comfortable of any of the earbuds (premiums included), and feel like they will stay in on a run even though they don't have any sort of little hook like the soundcore or powerbeats, or over ear hook like the others. Definitely the best ergonomics. Would take this over the JBL endurance or any other in the sub $150 price range.Soundcore Sport X10 - $69.99more satisfying for non edm music than the other options down below. Better separation for instruments and vocals.Compared against JLabs with blue tips in, the bass is more comparable. Soundcore keeps more clarity than on higher end (albeit a little tinny sounding), than JLabsBass is definitely much better than JLabs. It does feel a bit more muddy because of the heavier bass, there may have been better vocal clarity with JLabsEverything else seems fineANC is decentsmall profile is light, really comfortable and stays in the earsJLab JBuds Air Sport - $69.88bigger profile, slightly less comfortable than the Soundcore. Bass is lacking out of the box. There's better mid and high clarity on these than the soundcore.Bass improves a noticeable amount by switching to blue tips, but you lose some clarity higher upbass feels punchier in edm in these than x10These are definitely more satisfying for thumpy edm music than the x10The sound quality just feels lacking in depth, no matter which eq setting you choose.Has a connected usb charger on the case as a charger (rather than a separate chord to plug into both charger and power), which I don't think I likeJBL Endurance Peak 3 - $89.95Clear vocals and instruments in mids and highs. Slightly more clear and crisp than the soundcoreNice bass as well, (slightly worse bass than soundcore), less satisfying than the sound core on lyrical song but actually has punchier bass on edmPlenty loud (other reviews saying they don't get loud)The equalizer app gives lots of controlThis bass is also superior once equalized. So both bass and instrumental/vocals have more clarity. After messing with eq, is better than soundcore.This sounded perfectly fine until compared with higher tier, then when a/b compared it sounded a bit more fake, a bit more digital, definitely enough to notice a differenceGolrex $29.99It is okay sound, probably the best in this price range. If you just want something cheap that will give you sound, these are fine. If you care about sound quality even a little bit, it's worth it to get a better headset.There is no clarity at any frequency, just a decent amount of noise.Has an attempted cheap premium look with led interfaces.BMani  T16 $39.99Sounds way below average, worse than the golrex.Really similar packaging and look to the golrex, so they're either just copying each other or made by the same peopleRead more"
"HyperX Cloud III Wireless ‚Äì Gaming Headset for PC, PS5, PS4, up to 120-hour Battery, 2.4GHz Wireless, DTS Spatial Audio, 53mm Angled Drivers, Memory Foam, Durable Frame, 10mm Microphone, Black",$129.90,4.4 out of 5 stars,"8,505","I've owned two HyperX headsets over the course of the last 6-7 years and don't think I'll ever buy another brand again. I am notoriously bad with headsets.These guys have been through it all. Used at minimum 8 hours a day, sometimes longer. Have left them outside  in the rain, have sat/stepped on them numerous times, even once fell off a 2 floor balcony onto concrete...Nothing but a couple scratches. The first headset, despite being chewed up a bit (from both me and my dog) still worked flawlessly when I made the choice to upgrade to this guy.This one is just as amazing and even a little bit better. Battery life is INSANE and feels almost like a loophole in physics. The connection range is also massive, have worked on my lawn/backyard and never lose connection, even at the end of my driveway. Sound is crisp and buttons feel great to use. It's ""slightly"" more heavy than the previous versions, but wouldn't even consider that a flaw since it's more of a ""solid build"" heavy than a ""bulky"" heavy if that makes sense.Both super comfortable to wear for long period of times...to the point where I sometimes forget I'm wearing them till my wife puzzingly asks me ""Why are you wearing those?"".5 stars all around.Read more"
"LEVN Bluetooth Headset with Microphone, Trucker Bluetooth Headset with AI Noise Cancelling & Mute Button, Wireless On-Ear Headphones 60 Hrs Working Time, for Trucker Home Office Remote Work Zoom",$39.97,4.3 out of 5 stars,"2,014","Here's a detailed review based on its advertised features:Design and Comfort (On-Ear): The on-ear design generally offers a good balance between comfort and portability. It typically rests on the ears rather than fully encompassing them, which can be more comfortable for extended wear, especially in warmer environments or for those who dislike the ""sealed-off"" feeling of over-ear headphones. Many trucker headsets are designed to be lightweight with adjustable headbands and rotating earcups to ensure a secure and comfortable fit for various head sizes, which is crucial for long shifts or workdays.Audio Quality and AI Noise Cancelling:AI Noise Cancelling (Microphone): This is the flagship feature for professionals. AI-powered noise cancellation in the microphone is designed to intelligently distinguish your voice from background noise. For truckers, this means engine hum, road noise, and general cabin sounds should be significantly suppressed for the person on the other end of the call. For home office or remote work, it tackles distractions like children playing, pets, keyboard clicks, or ambient room noise. This ensures your voice comes through crystal clear, which is paramount for professional communication on Zoom, Teams, or phone calls.Audio Output: While the primary focus is often on microphone clarity for calls, the on-ear headphones should provide clear audio for listening to calls, music, or other media. The quality is likely optimized for voice clarity.Functionality and Control:Mute Button: A dedicated, easily accessible mute button on the headset is a non-negotiable feature for remote work and conference calls. It allows for quick muting and unmuting without fumbling for controls on your computer or software, preventing embarrassing interruptions.Bluetooth Connectivity: It connects wirelessly via Bluetooth, offering freedom of movement. Modern Bluetooth versions (likely 5.0 or higher) ensure stable connections and good range.Compatibility: Designed for universal use, it should seamlessly connect with laptops, desktop computers, smartphones, and tablets, making it versatile for various work setups.Battery Life (60 Hours Working Time): The 60 hours of working time is an outstanding battery life for a wireless headset, especially for one with active noise cancellation on the microphone. This means it can easily last multiple shifts for truckers or an entire work week for office users on a single charge. This minimizes the hassle of frequent recharging and ensures the headset is always ready when needed, a significant advantage for demanding schedules.Target Users: Truckers: The AI noise cancellation, long battery life, and comfortable on-ear design are perfectly suited for long hours on the road, ensuring clear communication with dispatchers or family.Home Office / Remote Work: For professionals dealing with ambient home noise, this headset provides the clarity needed for effective virtual meetings and calls.Zoom / Online Meetings: The noise-cancelling microphone and mute button directly address key pain points in online conferencing.Overall Verdict: The EVN Bluetooth Headset with Microphone is a highly appealing option for professionals who demand clear communication in noisy environments and extended battery life. The combination of AI noise cancellation for the microphone, a convenient mute button, and an impressive 60-hour working time makes it exceptionally well-suited for truckers, home office workers, and anyone frequently engaged in remote work or online meetings. Its on-ear design likely prioritizes comfort for long periods of wear. While specific details on audio driver quality for music might vary, its core strength lies in providing crystal-clear voice communication, making it a valuable tool for enhancing productivity and connectivity.Pros: Exceptional Battery Life:** 60 hours is well above average, minimizing charging frequency.AI Noise Cancelling Microphone: Crucial for clear communication in loud environments, suppressing background noise.Dedicated Mute Button: Essential for seamless virtual meetings and calls.On-Ear Design: Generally comfortable for extended wear.Wireless Convenience: Bluetooth connectivity for freedom of movement.Versatile: Ideal for trucking, home office, remote work, and online platforms.Cons:Specific audio output quality for music listening isn't the primary focus and may not satisfy audiophiles.On-ear design might not provide as much passive noise isolation for the *user* as over-ear headphones.Read more"
Beats Solo Buds - Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds | 18 Hours of Battery Life | Apple & Android Compatibility | Built-in Microphone - Storm Gray,,4.2 out of 5 stars,"3,169","So happy with these!!! Unfortunately - after over 5 years of my Powerbeats Pro - I ended up losing a bud on a plane ride. :( I did some research and was not wanting to spend over $200 on the new Powerbeats Pros, I opted for the smaller earbuds. For one, I do appreciate the size!!! One thing that was a downside for me regarding the pros was the size of the case. Sure, the Studio Beats don‚Äôt charge in their case, but the battery life is hopeful!!! I ended up ordering a locking case from amazon for them too. Sound quality is great. They are super secure in my ears and do feel like they can withstand a hefty workout. Get on the beats trainnnn!!!!Read more"

"Sennheiser MOMENTUM 4 Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth for Crystal-Clear Calls w/Adaptive Noise Cancellation, 60h Battery Life, Customizable Sound & Lightweight Folding Design, Graphite",$265.95,4.0 out of 5 stars,"7,610","5 stars to me. 4 stars all around for the average consumer due to issues I believe others will find a problem with but I have found some workarounds forI will start off with the flaws (unfortunately it has em) from my experience and some solutions. They are mostly features based. I'll also address confusions and ""negative"" experiences as there are reviews where clearly it's the people and not the headphones that are the problem yet they are giving this a worse impression that it should have. And lastly praise what it has going well for itAlso, I will highly suggest downloading the new app version called smart control PLUS and install any firmware updates. Then go adjust settings or it will have some annoyances.FlawsOn-head detection: this causes most of the headaches. For those that like to free up an ear to listen to someone talk better - make a habit of freeing your left ear and not the right. There is a sensor to detect your ear and it is only INSIDE the right earcup.  It makes a double click noise when it detects and stops detecting your ear. Unfortunately it makes a similar sound for both which is a huge flaw as you might not know if it is detecting or not sometimes. This will trigger the auto off feature if it doesn't detect you while you're listening to music. It usually pauses from the headset, but there is a possibility it can be ignored by an app and continue playing so when you put it back on you might not even know if it detected you. Another possibility is you made the mistake of pressing play from the app itself when it stops detecting you thus eventually triggering the sleep feature. You can disable auto off but I personally put it in 1 hour just in case as I would have likely readjusted my headset by that point and reset it. This goes into the next feature: auto play. It's perfectly fine on mobile but on PC it can be a nightmare as you could be listening to music, you adjust your right earcup so it pauses and when you put it back on, it might play some other video like youtube in an open browser; it depends on the programs that behave to bluetooth pause/play. So don't have so many open video/audio programs in the background. Also for those with long hair, autoplay can struggle to detect if it completely covers your right ear (some people start to think it stopped working). Overall, I just disabled autoplay while keeping auto-off enabled as I mainly use the M4 on PC, but again, it seems to work really well on mobile. Plus of course if any of these aren't necessary to you, you can simply disable it as a whole for an old fashioned headphone experience to avoid annoyances but I have gotten used to it at this point that I rarely have issues [Update: I just learned on May 2025 that as of the new firmware 2.13.42 it reads ""Improved auto-off behavior reducing unexpected behavior during calls or streaming due to misdetection in smart pause sensor"", so perhaps this section might become untrue with less flaws down the road thus hopefully improving user experience]Multi- point connection: It can and will connect to two devices that have bluetooth active after they have been paired. There are individuals that pair their headphones to everything and might experience a random connection. Unfortunately no disabling this so you have to be precise with what you want to connect this with. I only paired this to PC and mobile so it doesn't attempt to connect to anything else but in the app you can click to what else in the list want to connect to (or delete). When it detects multiple signals it will prioritize connecting to what you last used, it seems. Not an issue for me. Also, it will ALWAYS prioritize audio for the first connection of the two which will usually be the phone. This is important. If it connects to my phone first, well lets say Im on the PC listening to music, once your phone makes any kind of sound, your audio will switch to it and interrupt the music, then resume playing your PC's music. Because of this, disable useless sounds like the lock screen opening sounds because that will trigger a switch (not sure about typing sounds). I have sound on for notifications to get my attention for the phone but if that is an annoyance I would try connecting other devices (like PC) as your main device first and then phone second. That way, it will ONLY play audio on the main device (PC) in spite of your phone making noises or playing audio. I tend to disable phone bluetooth, so it isn't an issue for me what connects first anyways. Now, this is a major flaw which may have been addressed in the new firmware update and app but I have not fully tested yet so this is based on months old experience. Last flaw with this. Do not have constant audio playing on -BOTH- devices because it will cause some static to what you are listening to. No idea why this happens but sometimes the music sounds glitchy and I realize it's because my PC is playing music alongside my phone. All it takes is not having something like music playing on the second device and it gets clean.Reboot: it can be done on the power button after holding for over 15 seconds. Be careful NOT to do this if it is not your intention. I have a friend who accidentally did thisHigh resolution: app is glitched if you try to do personalized sound after enabling high resolution. It will ask you to disable high resolution before proceeding. All you have to do is go to standard mode, make your sound profile, then go back and enable High Resolution.Confusions:ANC: some people complain you can't turn off ANC. You sort of can. Old app, on the ANC slide, you put the slider in the middle. Most importantly, the new version of the app now allows to turn off ANC and might possibly increase your battery life. Oh, and some people remark of ANC randomly activating when outside. That is the wind noise reduction activating during air blowing directly to your mics. You can turn it off in ANC settings (you can also adjust transparency during phone calls there) but trust me that you don't want to hear wind transmitted into a headsetAuto-answer calls: complaints on this but another reason you need the app to disable it if you don't want it.Aut-connect: some complain that if it moves it will auto connect or cause confusion when they don't know why their bluetooth loud speakers stopped working until they realize the headphones are connected. I personally love auto connect and has never been an issue. I put my headphones away where it won't move at all and once I grab it, boom, just straightforward and smooth connection grab and go. This is a feature of auto off so if you don't want it to be doing this you can either disable auto off (more like sleep) or turn off the headphones directly from the power button (which means you will also have to turn it back on with the button). I don't think of it as a flaw to be honestDiscord/meeting calls: This is a big one. There are people mentioning how when they get on discord, their music and game sounds muffled. That is its hands free activating because it believes you are in a call. It prioritizes the call once it is activating its mic. You may have noticed it on your phone before too with music getting muffled. Problem is these then get compared directly to a gaming headset. Most gaming headsets have a usb dongle. Those dongles are designed to give both high quality low latency audio and mic signals at the same time. These? They are bluetooth headsets not specifically designed for gaming but rather for high quality audio. This is not a major fault of the headset. There exists a workaround for this but you will have to disable handsfree and rely on a different mic (which can be a far superior option anyways). To do this - on windows 11, go to settings. Click ""bluetooth & devices"". Then click on ""view more devices"" up top to go to a drop down list of devices. Scroll all the way down until you find ""more devices and printer settings"". Find the M4 headset, right click and go to properties. Click on the hardware tab. On this list, look for Name ""Momentum 4 Hands-Free"" that is under Type ""Sound, Video..."". Click once on it then click on properties below. In properties, General tab, click on the blue and yellow shield that says Change Settings. Then go to the Driver tab and Click Disable Driver. Reboot PC. Can be undone in similar method. At this point it has no headset mic active ~specifically~ on the PC (phone should be unaffected) so audio will be clear but now an external mic will be needed.Experiences:Connectivity: people say they have connectivity issues but thankfully it is very rare for me. It has a good distance to it too. I keep up to date with everything on my phoneTouchpad: some say it is very sensitive. It is certainly more sensitive than usual but there are exaggerations to it. My hair does not trigger it. Turning my head does not trigger it. I don't trigger it with a hoodie on. I don't wear beanies over it (why would you?) so I cant say anything there. Stretching my arms above my head might trigger and laying my head on the right side might make it think you want to change volume or transparency. But some of these reviews are funny. They are not rated to be water resistant at all (like most headsets) so if rain drops trigger it, actually no, WHY DO YOU EVEN HAVE IT IN THE RAIN?App: the app is fine minus the glitch [refer to High Resolution in Flaws] and has only been improving bit by bit. There's now also a new version which requires a new download that will likely be getting more of a focus onDurability: it is plastic which makes it lighter but thankfully I have not broken anything. I have bumped it into things, dropped it once. I try to treat is as glass so these are rare occurrences. I would not work out in these due to the fact they are not designed to deal with liquid. If problems occur because you work out in these, well that's your fault, but there exist rubber sweat covers to put over the padding to help out a bit. The Sennheisers Momentum 4/Sport earbuds I believe have water resistance and might be worth a look instead if you need a true gym companionStrengthsAudio quality: right out of the box, they are great. It has a neutral sound profile while having some attention to bass. There are presets in the app that are decent and it really does not need a bass booster but it exists. To be honest, I would skip everything and go straight for the sound personalization feature in the app. It's very simple to adjust, uses mostly sliders while you listen to audio. And once you are done it will create a setting that somehow manages to be far superior than what's already available in the app. It just cleans up the sound so much more to your liking; the difference is bewildering. Ever since that point, I have not listened to music the same. Just when I thought I was getting bored of music, these revived that love to want to listen to everything again and also motivated me to listen to things I never did before. There is literally pre-Sennheiser and during-Sennheiser eras to me now and am curious to their wired headsets. One thing that will become super noticeable is its soundstage. It spreads the instruments to a degree where you can notice more of everything. Albeit, this can be discombobulating and bassheads might not like the lack of sharp precision but this isn't meant to be your average linear listening experience (the Accentum Plus offers this at a much lower price). To give an example: What is Life by George Harrison. I might prefer it on the more linear style I am used to but these can separate things to the point where it is also directional and you can feel like you are standing at a concert and George is directly in the middle of it all in front of you so it feels more real- similar to as if you are becoming conscious of your own breathing. And in midst of all the chaos, you can still clearly hear George's voice and you notice ALL of the instruments more. It first gave me goosebumps how much it changed the song. Some songs are designed to be ""linear"" which could possibly affect emotional type of songs negatively but from a musical perspective, my goodness it is incredible. Now I just go back to see what music I am used to that changes with these (hint: a lot). Electronic/hip-hop music perhaps is the exception but this gives such clarity to detail that it is still a great listen- one thing is for sure these headsets love when there is a band setup (Bjork, the Roots, Gorillaz, etc). Sound quality is the biggest reason you go for these.Comfort: I can go on for a while without my ears hurting or anything. Also these don't heat up much and has proper adjustability for bigger headsLook: I have the black with copper ring and they are absolutely gorgeous. I question the longevity of the cloth on the headstrap but it makes it more beautiful than it has any business being for a plastic headsetFeatures: ANC is better than I expected. It does its job, and though it might not lead in this category, the differences are so small compared to the competition. Also drowned out what I needed it to during plane trips. And hearthrough, although I have had better, they will more than suffice to the point where I rarely have any issues hearing people. The fact that it is good at both of these is amazing for value.Battery: they can go up to nearly 60 hours, especially in standard mode. Not an exaggeration. I can go days without charging them. For this quality of headset, I don't think much of the competition comes close to this. In fact this is the mind blowing part because most other bluetooth headsets don't sound anywhere as good as these and they have half the battery life if not worse. No fears when travelling that it will die on me. In fact, it lasted me an entire week's tripSurprisesGaming: it has low enough latency. Combine that with that very clean audio and surprising directional audio this already has and wow, it performs quite well. I can actually spot details better and sometimes extra details I wasn't aware like I remember distinctly many months ago when I played Paladins, not only was I able to hear behind a wall slightly above me, but I realized it was subtle high heel sounds. I am not saying this will replace top of the line gaming headsets like steel series but if you have these and not a gaming headset, these will more than suffice.Charging: I was already enamored by the battery life but the fact is, it handles charging nearly as well. You can get hours worth per 10 minutes of charging and around an hour and a half or so it will be fully charged. That may not sound great but half of that will net you 30 hours of life which is STILL more than the competition. And the other surprise was that I accidentally discovered on the PC that you can still use it while charging - it simply appears as a different sound output you have to switch to. I thought it was weird how multiple momentum 4's appeared but when I clicked the other output, music started booming through it again. I was shocked. It already has a super long battery life with quick charging. It doesn't need it yet it has it. I have never had a headset that allows that with USB-C. Sennheiser were practically showing off at this point. So I would get a super long cable to make this comfortable during charging if you think this is a feature you will be usingThese are already the greatest -bluetooth- headsets I have ever owned under the $500 mark. I have tried out direct competitors Airpods Max (best hearthrough and good clean quality) and Sony Xm5's (amazing features and stylish) but the M4 felt like a no brainer. The max have poor battery life (under 20 hours) meanwhile these can reach close to triple that. The XM5's are light and so smooth with their features and touchpad (I loved speak to chat) but their fragility comes into question as they are notorious for the hinges breaking no matter how good you take care of them while the M4's mostly have earpads wearing down (easily replaceable). Meanwhile, guess what? The M4's imo sound better than both of them, are more comfortable than both, and can be found MUCH cheaper than both as I have seen it as low as $190. Even if, say, the Bowers & Wilkins PX8 might have slightly better audio and a better build, it's not a major difference so it is imo horrifically overpriced while this just has much higher value after sales and is an easier recommendationOverall, it absolutely bothers me just how overrated the other headsets on Amazon usually are meanwhile these get a bad impression. If you are a fan of music and you want to improve that experience with the bluetooth format at great affordability, it doesn't get better than theseRead more"

Plus of course if any of these aren't necessary to you, you can simply disable it as a whole for an old fashioned headphone experience to avoid annoyances but I have gotten used to it at this point that I rarely have issues [Update: I just learned on May 2025 that as of the new firmware 2.13.42 it reads ""Improved auto-off behavior reducing unexpected behavior during calls or streaming due to misdetection in smart pause sensor"", so perhaps this section might become untrue with less flaws down the road thus hopefully improving user experience]Multi- point connection: It can and will connect to two devices that have bluetooth active after they have been paired. There are individuals that pair their headphones to everything and might experience a random connection. Unfortunately no disabling this so you have to be precise with what you want to connect this with. I only paired this to PC and mobile so it doesn't attempt to connect to anything else but in the app you can click to what else in the list want to connect to (or delete). When it detects multiple signals it will prioritize connecting to what you last used, it seems. Not an issue for me. Also, it will ALWAYS prioritize audio for the first connection of the two which will usually be the phone. This is important. If it connects to my phone first, well lets say Im on the PC listening to music, once your phone makes any kind of sound, your audio will switch to it and interrupt the music, then resume playing your PC's music. Because of this, disable useless sounds like the lock screen opening sounds because that will trigger a switch (not sure about typing sounds). I have sound on for notifications to get my attention for the phone but if that is an annoyance I would try connecting other devices (like PC) as your main device first and then phone second. That way, it will ONLY play audio on the main device (PC) in spite of your phone making noises or playing audio. I tend to disable phone bluetooth, so it isn't an issue for me what connects first anyways. Now, this is a major flaw which may have been addressed in the new firmware update and app but I have not fully tested yet so this is based on months old experience. Last flaw with this. Do not have constant audio playing on -BOTH- devices because it will cause some static to what you are listening to. No idea why this happens but sometimes the music sounds glitchy and I realize it's because my PC is playing music alongside my phone. All it takes is not having something like music playing on the second device and it gets clean.Reboot: it can be done on the power button after holding for over 15 seconds. Be careful NOT to do this if it is not your intention. I have a friend who accidentally did thisHigh resolution: app is glitched if you try to do personalized sound after enabling high resolution. It will ask you to disable high resolution before proceeding. All you have to do is go to standard mode, make your sound profile, then go back and enable High Resolution.Confusions:ANC: some people complain you can't turn off ANC. You sort of can. Old app, on the ANC slide, you put the slider in the middle. Most importantly, the new version of the app now allows to turn off ANC and might possibly increase your battery life. Oh, and some people remark of ANC randomly activating when outside. That is the wind noise reduction activating during air blowing directly to your mics. You can turn it off in ANC settings (you can also adjust transparency during phone calls there) but trust me that you don't want to hear wind transmitted into a headsetAuto-answer calls: complaints on this but another reason you need the app to disable it if you don't want it.Aut-connect: some complain that if it moves it will auto connect or cause confusion when they don't know why their bluetooth loud speakers stopped working until they realize the headphones are connected. I personally love auto connect and has never been an issue. I put my headphones away where it won't move at all and once I grab it, boom, just straightforward and smooth connection grab and go. This is a feature of auto off so if you don't want it to be doing this you can either disable auto off (more like sleep) or turn off the headphones directly from the power button (which means you will also have to turn it back on with the button). I don't think of it as a flaw to be honestDiscord/meeting calls: This is a big one. There are people mentioning how when they get on discord, their music and game sounds muffled. That is its hands free activating because it believes you are in a call. It prioritizes the call once it is activating its mic. You may have noticed it on your phone before too with music getting muffled. Problem is these then get compared directly to a gaming headset. Most gaming headsets have a usb dongle. Those dongles are designed to give both high quality low latency audio and mic signals at the same time. These? They are bluetooth headsets not specifically designed for gaming but rather for high quality audio. This is not a major fault of the headset. There exists a workaround for this but you will have to disable handsfree and rely on a different mic (which can be a far superior option anyways). To do this - on windows 11, go to settings. Click ""bluetooth & devices"". Then click on ""view more devices"" up top to go to a drop down list of devices. Scroll all the way down until you find ""more devices and printer settings"". Find the M4 headset, right click and go to properties. Click on the hardware tab. On this list, look for Name ""Momentum 4 Hands-Free"" that is under Type ""Sound, Video..."". Click once on it then click on properties below. In properties, General tab, click on the blue and yellow shield that says Change Settings. Then go to the Driver tab and Click Disable Driver. Reboot PC. Can be undone in similar method. At this point it has no headset mic active ~specifically~ on the PC (phone should be unaffected) so audio will be clear but now an external mic will be needed.Experiences:Connectivity: people say they have connectivity issues but thankfully it is very rare for me. It has a good distance to it too. I keep up to date with everything on my phoneTouchpad: some say it is very sensitive. It is certainly more sensitive than usual but there are exaggerations to it. My hair does not trigger it. Turning my head does not trigger it. I don't trigger it with a hoodie on. I don't wear beanies over it (why would you?) so I cant say anything there. Stretching my arms above my head might trigger and laying my head on the right side might make it think you want to change volume or transparency. But some of these reviews are funny. They are not rated to be water resistant at all (like most headsets) so if rain drops trigger it, actually no, WHY DO YOU EVEN HAVE IT IN THE RAIN?App: the app is fine minus the glitch [refer to High Resolution in Flaws] and has only been improving bit by bit. There's now also a new version which requires a new download that will likely be getting more of a focus onDurability: it is plastic which makes it lighter but thankfully I have not broken anything. I have bumped it into things, dropped it once. I try to treat is as glass so these are rare occurrences. I would not work out in these due to the fact they are not designed to deal with liquid. If problems occur because you work out in these, well that's your fault, but there exist rubber sweat covers to put over the padding to help out a bit. The Sennheisers Momentum 4/Sport earbuds I believe have water resistance and might be worth a look instead if you need a true gym companionStrengthsAudio quality: right out of the box, they are great. It has a neutral sound profile while having some attention to bass. There are presets in the app that are decent and it really does not need a bass booster but it exists. To be honest, I would skip everything and go straight for the sound personalization feature in the app. It's very simple to adjust, uses mostly sliders while you listen to audio. And once you are done it will create a setting that somehow manages to be far superior than what's already available in the app. It just cleans up the sound so much more to your liking; the difference is bewildering. Ever since that point, I have not listened to music the same. Just when I thought I was getting bored of music, these revived that love to want to listen to everything again and also motivated me to listen to things I never did before. There is literally pre-Sennheiser and during-Sennheiser eras to me now and am curious to their wired headsets. One thing that will become super noticeable is its soundstage. It spreads the instruments to a degree where you can notice more of everything. Albeit, this can be discombobulating and bassheads might not like the lack of sharp precision but this isn't meant to be your average linear listening experience (the Accentum Plus offers this at a much lower price). To give an example: What is Life by George Harrison. I might prefer it on the more linear style I am used to but these can separate things to the point where it is also directional and you can feel like you are standing at a concert and George is directly in the middle of it all in front of you so it feels more real- similar to as if you are becoming conscious of your own breathing. And in midst of all the chaos, you can still clearly hear George's voice and you notice ALL of the instruments more. It first gave me goosebumps how much it changed the song. Some songs are designed to be ""linear"" which could possibly affect emotional type of songs negatively but from a musical perspective, my goodness it is incredible. Now I just go back to see what music I am used to that changes with these (hint: a lot). Electronic/hip-hop music perhaps is the exception but this gives such clarity to detail that it is still a great listen- one thing is for sure these headsets love when there is a band setup (Bjork, the Roots, Gorillaz, etc). Sound quality is the biggest reason you go for these.Comfort: I can go on for a while without my ears hurting or anything. Also these don't heat up much and has proper adjustability for bigger headsLook: I have the black with copper ring and they are absolutely gorgeous. I question the longevity of the cloth on the headstrap but it makes it more beautiful than it has any business being for a plastic headsetFeatures: ANC is better than I expected. It does its job, and though it might not lead in this category, the differences are so small compared to the competition. Also drowned out what I needed it to during plane trips. And hearthrough, although I have had better, they will more than suffice to the point where I rarely have any issues hearing people. The fact that it is good at both of these is amazing for value.Battery: they can go up to nearly 60 hours, especially in standard mode. Not an exaggeration. I can go days without charging them. For this quality of headset, I don't think much of the competition comes close to this. In fact this is the mind blowing part because most other bluetooth headsets don't sound anywhere as good as these and they have half the battery life if not worse. No fears when travelling that it will die on me. In fact, it lasted me an entire week's tripSurprisesGaming: it has low enough latency. Combine that with that very clean audio and surprising directional audio this already has and wow, it performs quite well. I can actually spot details better and sometimes extra details I wasn't aware like I remember distinctly many months ago when I played Paladins, not only was I able to hear behind a wall slightly above me, but I realized it was subtle high heel sounds. I am not saying this will replace top of the line gaming headsets like steel series but if you have these and not a gaming headset, these will more than suffice.Charging: I was already enamored by the battery life but the fact is, it handles charging nearly as well. You can get hours worth per 10 minutes of charging and around an hour and a half or so it will be fully charged. That may not sound great but half of that will net you 30 hours of life which is STILL more than the competition. And the other surprise was that I accidentally discovered on the PC that you can still use it while charging - it simply appears as a different sound output you have to switch to. I thought it was weird how multiple momentum 4's appeared but when I clicked the other output, music started booming through it again. I was shocked. It already has a super long battery life with quick charging. It doesn't need it yet it has it. I have never had a headset that allows that with USB-C. Sennheiser were practically showing off at this point. So I would get a super long cable to make this comfortable during charging if you think this is a feature you will be usingThese are already the greatest -bluetooth- headsets I have ever owned under the $500 mark. I have tried out direct competitors Airpods Max (best hearthrough and good clean quality) and Sony Xm5's (amazing features and stylish) but the M4 felt like a no brainer. The max have poor battery life (under 20 hours) meanwhile these can reach close to triple that. The XM5's are light and so smooth with their features and touchpad (I loved speak to chat) but their fragility comes into question as they are notorious for the hinges breaking no matter how good you take care of them while the M4's mostly have earpads wearing down (easily replaceable). Meanwhile, guess what? The M4's imo sound better than both of them, are more comfortable than both, and can be found MUCH cheaper than both as I have seen it as low as $190. Even if, say, the Bowers & Wilkins PX8 might have slightly better audio and a better build, it's not a major difference so it is imo horrifically overpriced while this just has much higher value after sales and is an easier recommendationOverall, it absolutely bothers me just how overrated the other headsets on Amazon usually are meanwhile these get a bad impression. If you are a fan of music and you want to improve that experience with the bluetooth format at great affordability, it doesn't get better than theseRead more"

"Apple AirPods Max Wireless Over-Ear Headphones, Pro-Level Active Noise Cancellation, Transparency Mode, Personalized Spatial Audio, USB-C Charging, Bluetooth Headphones for iPhone - Starlight",,4.6 out of 5 stars,"1,696","I bought these fully with the intention of reviewing them to see if I should buy them if they were to ever go on sale, but I honestly want to keep them‚Ä¶First Impression: Wowww PrettyBuild: Pretty Good (They're made out of metal)Weight: Honestly, it didn't bother me at all. I didn't find these heavy whatsoever. They are heavier than the other headphones in this class (I think) But I can lean back and look at the ceiling for a while if I want and not really be bothered (Not recommended).ANC: Better than my xm4 but honestly when you're playing music around/over 55% you can't hear anything, just like any other ANC headphones IMO. This isn't a jab at the APM the ANC is very good but IMO when you're playing music past 50% on any headphones I don't think you hear anything but music. TLDR: ANC: Very SolidTransparency: The ANC as mentioned is ""very solid"", but the TRANSPARENCY is all the hype it's very useful for me because when lifting one ear cup it kinda hurts but transparency mode takes care of that. (pretty sure they'll loosen through wear anyway.Comfort: Weight doesn't bother me at all and the ear cups are very comfortable to me, but I can see them wearing as time goes by but very comfyAudio: Without spacial audio, the headphones are ""Ok"" (also not a jab. I was able to connect these to my pc and without spacial audio they‚Äôre actually way better than ok), I think you'd got the best out of the APM with it on, and for me and my short testing I couldn't hear the difference in music between YouTube, Spotify, or even Apple Music but I've seen multiple reviews saying that audio sounds just a bit better on apple music.Price: If they were just a little cheaper or were to go on sale for under 350-400 I'd say that's a pretty nice snatch (for me) but if you're balling like that and are involved in the ecosystem with more than just you're phone and don‚Äôt wanna wait... Why not YOLOSo overall IMO the APM are actually pretty good ik that sounds pretty bad and shallow for a description of a $500 pair of headphones, but they‚Äôre not completely trash as some would say for the price. At the end of the day, everything is subjective and everyone has their own opinions and experiences and I was just yapping about mine. Edit: mind you this is around my first 8 hours with the headphones. I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôll have more opinions on comfort over time, heat, ‚Äúcondensation‚Äù, and battery life.Read more"

The packaging was well thought out and tore apart easily in my hands. It was simply laid out, with a little plastic box of earbuds (many types, several sizes). I connected the inner-ear-hook pieces and they fit right in there. The attached photo shows memory foam inserts, which are the display option. My ear holes are small, and these‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt even tell that they‚Äôre in my ears.I looped the band around my neck. It‚Äôs light but solid. I could probably step on these and they would be fine. I held down the center of the three buttons on the right side of the neck band, and a little purple light came on. A woman‚Äôs voice told me ‚ÄúBattery High‚Äù. Score. It‚Äôs charged right out of the box. My phone was playing R&B, and when I Bluetooth paired the headphones (easy peasy, it showed up immediately), the bass came through beautifully. There was real boommm booommmm to it at half volume. I‚Äôm at less than half volume as I do yard work, listening to an audiobook. Dude‚Ä¶ they sound GOOD. Not tinny, not far away. Solid connection when I walked into my garage.These replaced some budget sennheisers I tried when my sub-$200 headphones went out. I like over ear headphones for yard work and the gym, but when I sweat a lot the lifespan of the headphones is limited. The sennheisers didn‚Äôt sound half this good, and I‚Äôm serious.

"Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds - Compatible with Apple & Android, Built-in Microphone, IPX4 Rating, Sweat Resistant Earphones, Class 1 Bluetooth Headphones - Black",,4.2 out of 5 stars,"84,764","I bought these earbuds along with 4 other pairs, with the intent of comparing them over a couple weeks and returning all but my favorite.  Here were the results:Beats Fit Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JL65GNM?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros ‚Äì These buds had some great base, and the wingtip gave them a fit that made them refuse to fall out of my ears.  But the best feature?  Physical ‚Äúclicky‚Äù buttons on each one of the buds.  You press in and hear/feel the click, rather than relying on a touchscreen-like feature.  No need to guess if you tapped them once or twice, you will know.Cons ‚Äì The wingtip gives a very sturdy fit, but not the most comfortable. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend to anyone with smaller ears.  The noise canceling was solid, but nothing special.  And this may be picky, but I didn‚Äôt care for most of the color schemes available.  I prefer my earbuds to be hard to notice, and even the black ones have a bright red letter ‚Äúb‚Äù in the middle.Beats Studio Buds - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096SV8SJG?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros ‚Äì Very comfortable with the same great physically ‚Äúclicky‚Äù buttons as the Beats Fit Pro.  Noise canceling seemed slightly better than average.  Great base.  Classic look.Cons ‚Äì Tested during a workout, a little bit of sweat had these sliding right out of my ear.  The case for these earbuds also was the flimsiest of any I had tested, with a very weak hinge that I was scared of breaking off within the 2 weeks of using.Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MWZHHKP?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros ‚Äì A neat feature that I noticed only in these earbuds was that it had noise amplification as well as noise cancelation.  With one swipe in the app, the surrounding sound was actually louder and clearer than it would be without the earbuds in.  Great if you are hard of hearing, or just enjoy snooping on conversations out of reach.Cons ‚Äì Similar to the Beats Studio Buds, these didn‚Äôt stay in during a workout.  They were usable, but every 10 minutes I found myself pushing them back into my ear.  And this is an opinion, but these are the ugliest earbuds out of the bunch.  The shiny black gleam made it look like a large beetle was hanging out in my ear.  No visible brand placement either, which makes them appear cheap and generic rather than the quality Samsung they are.Samsung Galaxy Buds Live - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TBM1L3S?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros ‚Äì Cost effective!  I added these to the test group because of the unique shape, and for that they are worth giving a try.  If you have small ears and do not like the rubber insert that is standard in most other earbuds, these may be perfect for you.Cons ‚Äì Poor fit for large ears.  These were tested the least of all of the buds, because the fit was so bad for my ear shape that they wouldn‚Äôt stay in if I turned my head too fast.Bose QuietComfort  - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C4KWM9T?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros ‚Äì Bose noise canceling is unmatched.  If your primary use for earbuds is to cancel out that background white noise, this is the pair for you.  The sound quality is great, not too heavy on the base.  The case for the earbuds stood out from the rest as the only one that impressed me.  Felt very study, and I had no worries tossing it into a gym bag or cup holder.  The only case with a button latch to make sure it doesn‚Äôt open accidentally.Cons ‚Äì This was the most expensive pair of earbuds by a longshot, and there were still some things I felt could be improved.  The rubber inserts had more of a ‚Äúflayed‚Äù shape rather than the ‚Äúrounded‚Äù shape that is standard.  My guess is that this was by design, because the earbuds were also slightly heavier than others and may need that extra in-ear grip.  The flayed shape did make them sturdier, but at the cost of them being uncomfortable in an active situation.  They were also the largest earbuds, and stuck out from the side of my head further than I would have liked.My favorite?  The beats fit pro!  While I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this pair for everyone, it was perfect for my routine.  My music taste benefits from the boosted base, and the wingtip shape was perfect for any workouts.  The feature that really convinced me was the physical buttons, something that I didn‚Äôt realize how desperately I needed.Read more"
"JBL Live 460NC wireless on-ear Noise Cancelling headphones with 50H battery, microphone for calls, lightweight and comfortable, and Alexa Built-in (Optimized for Android), iOS compatible (Black)",,4.4 out of 5 stars,"7,133","I absolutely didn't need a pair of headphones having many already to choose from but I really wanted a pair of ANC on ear headphones and the selection with ANC is pretty slim.  So when the live 460nc went on sale, I decided to give them a go.As expected, the cans are much smaller than over the ear headphones and since they do fold up, they'll do very well on the go.  That was the main reason for the purchase.  I have a pair of over the ear cans (Anker Soundcore Q45) but I wanted something that would be smaller to travel with on airplanes.  The ANC would be to help drown out the engine noise.  As you can see in the pictures, they fold down nicely for storage.What I didn't know about was how well they integrate with Google Assistant.  I'm still trying to figure this out but when I paired them to my phone, it actually asked me to download the companion app which I did.  Through the app, I can change the equalizer and some other features that I have yet to fully explore.  But I was rather surprised that it did things my pixel buds do.  It'll read your messages by double tapping the left can or you can press and hold the left can and use assistant to do things.  I'm still working on all the things I can do right from the headphones.The button controls are entirely on the right can and the charging port is on the left one. I don't think the right can has a touch feature like the left can does. There is a 2.5mm jack on the right can.The headband padding isn't very substantial but at the same time, I don't find these uncomfortable.  They're quite comfy in fact.  They won't be as comfy as the Anker over the ear but I don't think there will be a problem wearing these for hours.  I've only tested them around the house for an hour at most and I got use to wearing them quite quickly.  And, i have a big head.  They didn't feel like they were squishing my head, something that is very very important.So far, I've only played audiobooks and a few songs from it but I've been pleased with what I'm hearing so far.  But I'm also not very picky.  So long as the ANC works well and I get good enough sound and it's comfy, I'm satisfied.  I'll be testing these in a couple of months on a cross country flight.  That will be a real test...5 hours on a plane. I'll update after that flight.Pro:  CompactComfy for on the earANCGoogle assistant integrationSimple controlsCons: ANC not quite as good as over ear but that's expected.Not as comfy as over ear but again, as expected.Truthfully, if you have reasonable expectations on these I think you won't be disappointed.  They're a solid mid range pair of headphones from a very good reputable company and they dish out good sound.  I'll have my son test them the next time he comes back from school.  He'll be a lot better at assessing the sound quality.  In my eyes though, these are a great purchase for the purpose I got them for...travel.Update: Took them on my recent trip and used them for hours on the plane.  The return flight was a 6 hr direct flight and I had them on the entire trip with no problems.  I watched movies through the entire flight and didn't have any issues hearing the audio from the movies.  I think there is better ANC in other headphones but that's also a factor of the design.  I don't expect to get ANC that's better than over the ear headphones.  But the comfort level was much better than i thought.  I didn't run hot which I often do with other on ear or over the ear headphones.  These were very comfortable for the flight.I didn't charge them after the flight there or back.  I still have 70% life left according to my phone.  So after 12 hours of use during flights to and from, I've still got 70%.  That to me is really good.For the price you can get these for, I think they're great.  I doubt they'll match up to anything like the Sony 1000XM-4 or 5s but they're also 1/3 the price on sale.Read more"
"Bowers & Wilkins Px8 Over-Ear Wireless Headphones, Advanced Active Noise Cancellation, Luxurious Materials, 30-Hour Battery Life, 15-Min Quick Charging, Black",,4.2 out of 5 stars,"1,551","I tested the Px7 S2e ‚Äôs and the Px8 ‚Äôs side by side.  The pricing was excellent on both‚Äî$240 for the 7‚Äôs and $450 for the 8‚Äôs, from the third-party seller GRAMOPHONE, whom I assume are the Amazon presence of Sky by Gramophone.  So my review will be colored by the excellent pricing I received.[Update & TL;DR:  after writing this review I went in to the kitchen to see about dinner, and a song came on and I did one more side by side test.  This song really changed my mind about potentially keeping both the 7‚Äôs and 8‚Äôs, and gave me resolve to be content only with the 8‚Äôs:  These Are The Days - Lauren Daigle.  I compared the final minute of that song on both, and I have to say with the 8‚Äôs that song sounded alive, but on the 7‚Äôs the song sounded the way a flat carbonated beverage tastes.  It was when the word ‚Äúalive‚Äù popped in to my head that I was struck.  It‚Äôs almost like those moments in the movies where someone will drop a needle on a record or hit play on a tape deck, and then the music starts playing in the diegetic world‚Äîon set, through microphones‚Äîand then as the scene closes the music transitions out of the movie world into the full-fidelity sound of the theater.  So if you can, strive for the 8‚Äôs if you‚Äôre a music lover and not just after active noise canceling headphones for general purposes.  Remember, this sounds like a slam on the 7‚Äôs but it‚Äôs not‚Äîit‚Äôs exaggerating a mild difference between two fine products for comparison‚Äôs sake.]After all is said and done, what I found was that when I was testing back and forth between the two, when I had on the 8‚Äôs, I tended to get lost in the music and just kept listening and looking for the next song, rather than remembering that I was supposed to be switching back and forth to test.  So the 8‚Äôs were more immersive and engaging.  And I found it happened again while typing this review; the 8‚Äôs just lower the barrier between you and the recording.  And this could happen at a slightly lower volume on the 8‚Äôs than on the 7‚Äôs.  And it could go without saying, but I‚Äôll say it‚Ä¶  these both blow the Sony XM4‚Äôs out of the water.  Airpods Max sound great in their own way, but these are both more refined.  (Sony and Apple comparisons are from memory, I no longer own those.)I noticed a couple of phenomena specifically with the 8‚Äôs‚Äîone that I have not noticed with any other headphones or speakers is that as I settled in with them, I tended to want to turn the volume DOWN.  I do not recall any other pair of headphones or speakers where that has been the case‚ÄîI feel like with everything else, if I‚Äôm really into the music, I want to turn it up for more‚Ä¶ whatever, engagement, detail, but after settling in with the 8‚Äôs for a few songs, I find that I‚Äôm fully immersed and settled in, and the volume wants reducing with no loss of experience.  Really unusual‚Äîbut I think that‚Äôs a good thing for delicate ears.  The second is that really lousy 60‚Äôs stereo ends up being much more pleasant than with other headphones and speakers‚Ä¶  what I mean is those mixes where one instrument comes completely out of one speaker and another instrument might come entirely out of another.  That overwhelming unbalance often sounds terrible to me on a lot of equipment‚Äîbut with the 8‚Äôs it‚Äôs not so unpleasant.  I double checked it against the 7‚Äôs and the 8‚Äôs really do make it less unpleasant.  (Example songs:  No Sugar Tonight / New Mother Nature by The Guess Who and Only You Know And I Know by Dave Mason.  When the first instrument comes in 100% on one side, there‚Äôs just more pressure against your one ear with most headphones, but for some reason with the 8‚Äôs, that imbalance is less profound and exerts less pressure.)Between the 7‚Äôs and the 8‚Äôs, I feel like the 7‚Äôs were more veiled and more muddy.  The 8‚Äôs had greater clarity and resolution.  I‚Äôm fully aware that those are all the words that audiophiles say you aren‚Äôt supposed to use.  But for normal people, those are really representative of the feeling.  There is a big difference when you are switching back and forth.  Other metaphors might be like 720p vs. 1080p for the 7‚Äôs vs. the 8‚Äôs.  One example would be Rock Steady by Aretha Franklin‚Äîthe percussion with the cowbell and g√ºira and the plucks of the bass strings are all more crisp and well defined on the 8‚Äôs than on the 7‚Äôs.  Both have punchy bass‚Äîas punchy as you want them to be.  The 7‚Äôs have punchier bass overall.  But I settled in with a -2.0 to -2.5 db cut to the bass in the app on both, and on the 8‚Äôs, which are less punchy anyways, the kick drum on Midnight Rider by The Allman Brothers Band and Sweet Love by Anita Baker was still too punchy for my taste, whereas the punchiness of Talkin‚Äô Tennessee by Morgan Wallen was spot-on for me (I didn‚Äôt switch over the 7‚Äôs for those tracks)‚Äîand cutting the bass to -3.0 db from -2.0 was not a solution as it brought down the overall experience of the rest of the bass a bit too much.  A note about the clarity and resolution of the 8‚Äôs though‚ÄîI don‚Äôt want to imply that it‚Äôs an overly trebly quality nor what audiophiles might call overly analytical‚Äîthey are not‚Äîthey still have a great deal of intimacy.  Both allow you to get intimate with the music, but the 8‚Äôs moreso‚Äîan example track would be the conclusion of Gratitude by Brandon Lake; I‚Äôd characterize the intimacy as deeper with the 8‚Äôs but still present with the 7‚Äôs‚Äîit‚Äôs a matter of intensity.  Like the 7‚Äôs make you say ‚Äúgreat‚Äù but the 8‚Äôs make you say ‚Äúwow.‚Äù  The 8‚Äôs literally made me stop what I was doing to pay attention and not miss the moment at the conclusion of that song.  (Kinda like that way that old Gap A‚Äô Go-Go TV commercial for khakis would make households stop, rapt, to watch, because it was shot in one continuous take.)  It‚Äôll be interesting to see what happens after burn-in, how and in what ways these headphones will mellow out.A word about vocals.  I feel like both are competent with vocals, but nothing to write home about.  However, there is one peculiarity‚Äîon one particular song, Rise Up (Lazarus) by Cain, the vocals seem to get buried on the 8‚Äôs.  They‚Äôre acceptable on the 7‚Äôs.  But I listened quite a number of times to figure out what was going on, and I‚Äôm not sure‚Äîperhaps it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs a highly-produced, high-complexity song; but I did source it from a CD ripped to ALAC downsampled to 256k AAC, and also tried it with the ‚ÄúVery High‚Äù quality through Spotify as well, and same results.  But on the 8‚Äôs, the vocals are really obscured.  The only thing I can think is that there‚Äôs some processing going on somewhere‚Äîthe lead vocals, backing vocals, the three-part harmonies, are just distant.  I pulled out some ‚Äúnormal‚Äù Airpods Pro 2nd Gen, and the vocals were more normal sounding, and this song always sounds great in my car (Harman Kardon).  I compared to a song like Bell-Bottomed Tear by The Beautiful South, with both male and female vocals, and that song sounds normal.  So I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on here but, you know, nothing‚Äôs perfect.  This might also be revealing a fault in the recording.All of that being said, if you don‚Äôt have them side by side, after a while, you‚Äôll be used to whichever ones you have and either pair is a blessing.  So budget is the largest factor in that respect and there‚Äôs no reason to strain for the 8‚Äôs if the 7‚Äôs are more appropriate for your pocketbook.  I think one use case difference might be the following:  if you‚Äôre going to be walking around listening to books on tape a lot, the 7‚Äôs are probably the way to go, since they‚Äôre more comfortable, and if you‚Äôre in a city, the noise and the world will be distracting‚Äîwhat would the 8‚Äôs be doing for you in those situations?  Ditto for the 7‚Äôs if you‚Äôre going to be concentrating on work and not the music.  If you‚Äôre going to be sitting at home, immobile, focused on music, that‚Äôs the main use case that shouts out that the 8‚Äôs are most appropriate.  Albeit, as I‚Äôm typing these words, and multitasking, I‚Äôm listening to the 8‚Äôs and I‚Äôm probably happier with the 8‚Äôs‚Äîso am I a hypocrite?Both the 7‚Äôs and the 8‚Äôs are:* The least fatiguing wearables I‚Äôve experienced, in the sonic sense.  (For me the Airpods Max were exceptionally fatiguing.)* Lack that ‚Äúvacuum packed‚Äù feeling when the noise cancellation is on.  At home, it‚Äôs very hard to tell the difference between the three modes if there‚Äôs no external sound (both in terms of sound quality and the feeling in your ears and body)‚ÄîI have to snap my fingers to be certain what the configuration is.  With Sony XM4‚Äôs, by contrast, you can tell in your body.* Laggy to connect to the app‚Ä¶ to look at the settings on the app, it can take 2 to 10 seconds for the app to connect even when they‚Äôre currently in use.  Sometimes it takes multiple attempts.  The app can show they are disconnected when in use too.  This is no biggie because how often are you going to adjust the settings after you‚Äôre settled in with them?* You can adjust the settings with the app while you are listening to an audio source on a different device entirely.Px8 ‚Äôs are:* Less comfortable, less headband padding, more pressure on jaw bone (my head is already narrow‚ÄîI need narrow eyeglass frames), warmer than the 7‚Äôs* Physically fatiguing near the jaw hinge for me.* Bass is pleasing and not overly punchy on most tracks.Px7 S2e ‚Äôs are:* More comfortable, have more headband padding, softer ear cups, cooler that the 8‚Äôs* Less physically fatiguing for me.* Punchier bass - a negative for me.* More ‚Äúforgiving‚Äù of inferior recordingsHonestly‚Äîone use case which is making me feel like I could keep both‚Äîthe Px7 S2e ‚Äôs might be nice as my outdoor headphones for listening to audiobooks and a less expensive loss if I get mugged since I‚Äôm in a city, and the Px8 ‚Äôs could stay home for music and less distracted situations.  I don‚Äôt know if I need two, but‚Ä¶I suppose only keeping one pair, the higher sound quality of the 8s would trump the greater comfort of the 7s.  I‚Äôll see how it plays out.  What I‚Äôm finding, though, is because the 8‚Äôs sound so much better, I put up with the physical discomfort and don‚Äôt want to take them off and switch to the 7‚Äôs for music.  For voice, lectures, audiobooks, TV, phone calls, Zoom calls, the 7‚Äôs would be the way to go.  One use case to think about if you‚Äôre on the fence or don‚Äôt want to overextend your wallet‚Ä¶ the 8‚Äôs are so good, they will really highlight the imperfections of poor quality recordings‚Äîbecause they are just older, pre-stereo, have tape hiss, or done on poor equipment or garage studios‚ÄîI really noticed this on You Go To My Head - Dinah Washington (Dinah Jams, live, mono), or old funk recordings like Dirty Ole Man - Irene Reid; Seeds Of Life - East LA Car Pool; I Get What I Want - The Sequins.  With a song like Go For Yourself - Kenny Smith & The Loveliters, the levels must be clipped on the master tapes and there is distortion, which the 7‚Äôs are more forgiving about than the 8‚Äôs.  If you listen mostly to older music and have budget constraints, the 7‚Äôs might be the way to go.I have a hunch that the 8‚Äôs might be the height of what is achievable within the bounds of bluetooth today.  I have compared the Focal Bathys‚Äîand I‚Äôd think they‚Äôre too analytical and fatiguing (sonically) for me, even though I love detail, a vast soundstage, and that in-the-room feeling (see my review of those too).Other representative test tracks I used:  Smoke a Little Smoke - Eric Church; Driveway - Cody Johnson; You Set My Soul - The Telescopes; Can‚Äôt You See - The Marshall Tucker Band; Blown a Wish - My Bloody Valentine; the popular Gordon Lightfoot numbers; Fall For Me - Brett Eldredge; Cheap Seats - Emily Scott Robinson; Christmas Time is Here - Zach Williams; Beginnings - Chicago; This Here - The Cannonball Adderly Quintet (‚Ä¶in San Francisco); Desafinado - Stan Getz, Jo√£o Gilberto; Little Lulu - Bill Evans Trio; Upstage Rumba - Dave BrubeckNote for the chemically sensitive‚Äîthe 8‚Äôs smell worse than the 7‚Äôs on day one.  (I‚Äôm writing this on day one.)  The cases for both are identical and also stink worse than the headphones.  However‚Äîthe good news is that I‚Äôm pretty chemically sensitive and my mucus membranes don‚Äôt react to these, so hopefully that is helpful data.Read more"

"JBL Vibe Beam - True Wireless JBL Deep Bass Sound Earbuds, Bluetooth 5.2, Water & Dust Resistant, Hands-free call with VoiceAware, Up to 32 hours of battery life (Black)",,4.3 out of 5 stars,"24,505","This review is about the audio features of the JBL Vibe Beam earbuds.I'm an audio engineer so audio quality is very important to me. As such, I use wired connections as much as possible to maintain the integrity of the audio signal.  However, many newer consumer-level products no longer have audio jacks, so I finally decided to invest in some wireless earbuds as a backup to the other earphones and headphones that I use.  I didn't want to spend a lot of money as I didn't foresee myself using this product very much, and since this is my first foray into wireless audio earphones, if they were just ok or they broke after a while, then I wouldn't feel too bad about the little money that I spent.  Also, I wanted to focus on finding wireless earbuds with excellent audio quality first as I already have an excellent high-end bluetooth earpiece for cell phone use, and I wouldn't be using this product as a bluetooth headset for my phone.After doing much research, I chose the JBL Vibe Beam's as they were at my price point, I'm familiar with JBL products, and I could reasonably expect that they were likely deliver the high audio quality that I've come to expect from JBL products.  In my research, I read reviews that complained about the harshness of the high end with high frequency instruments like cymbals or the lack of bass, so I was a bit concerned.When I received and started listening to my JBL Vibe Beams I understood what people were talking about.  However, to correct the issues, first, one must have a great fit of the earbuds in their ears.  I'm fortunate, in that with the medium tips that were already installed on the Vibe Beams, they made a snug fit in my ears right out of the box.  If you find that these earbuds do not fit well in your ears it might be worthwhile to invest in a separate set of variable sized earbud tips, or try tips from one of your other well-fitting earbuds, if you have them.  Once the earbuds were seated properly in my ear, that took care of the poor bass issue. (I have not worn them long-term so I can't speak to them falling out of my ear, as others have mentioned, but they seem to stay in pretty well.)For the misaligned frequency response issue, fortunately, the JBL Headphone app that you can install on your cell phone includes a ten-band graphic equalizer that you can use to make adjustments to the frequency response of your earbuds.  After listening to several of the reference tracks I use to check new audio equipment or my mixes against, I found that the only adjustments needed were carving out some of the upper midrange and making a very slight boost in the bottom end of the lower frequency spectrum.  I've included a screenshot of my EQ curve which I based on the Bass preset in the JBL app.  You can't tell as there is no dB scale on the side, but I needed to cut or boost by only 1-2 dB.  I find that my new EQ curve gives a more balanced frequency response than what came out of the box, and matches up well against the reference speaker system and headphones that I use for my audio mixing and mastering work.  I invite you to use my EQ curve as a starting point and adjust as sounds best to you.I also read reviews complaining about the apparent lack of volume of the Vibe Beams.  I connected the JBL's to several different sources (phone, computer, TV, MP3 player, etc.) and I found that the overall maximum volume (with limiter off) is relatively lower than wired speaker versions.  However, the input to the JBL's is relative to the maximum output of the source itself.  I found that the loudest level I could get came from my iPhone and the lowest level output came from my MP3 player (which probably doesn't offer much output anyway being a tiny portable unit).  As a comparison, I did a side-by-side test of the JBL's with my wife's AirPods (2nd gen).  What I found was that the JBL's offered an almost identical audio output level as the AirPods with any of the sources I used so that confirmed that the output level of the JBL's has more to do with the source (and the source material as some songs are mastered at a lower volume than other songs) than with the earbuds themselves.  During my test, I put the JBL's at their maximum volume output (one tap at a time on the left bud to raise the volume).  Also, I noticed during my testing that the AirPods had a pleasing midrange sound perfect for listening to podcasts or watching video, but the JBL's excelled at full-range sound on the bottom and top ends of the frequency spectrum which made them sound much better over all and well-suited for music or listening to explosive action scenes in movies.And speaking of movies, the JBL app has a switchable audio/video mode.  The video mode reduces the latency of the delivery of audio against picture, so there isn't a noticeable lip-sync issue with dialogue in a scene.  However, there is a slight degradation in the audio quality of 'video' mode versus 'audio' mode, but you will have to make the determination if the change in audio quality is acceptable to you.As a side note, I included a picture of the inner side of the earbuds.  The 'L' and 'R' designations on the earbuds are tiny as you can see, plus they are the same color as the earbuds themselves, so they are very hard to see.  I wish JBL had made the L/R letters bigger or at least made them a different color so they would be easier to see.The pairing process was fairly easy with all my bluetooth-capable devices and the range was good, only dropping out after walking approximately 60-70 feet from the source.  There was one momentary dropout during my listening but that could be due to my wife using her AirPods the same time as I was using the JBL's.I can't speak to the other features of the JBL Vibe Beams as I don't intend to use them, but as far as audio quality goes, with just a few minor tweaks, these bluetooth earbuds can go from sounding like a $50 pair of earbuds to a $500 pair of reference earphones.Read more"
"Boean Bluetooth Headphones, Wireless Headphones with 16 Hours Playtime Bluetooth 5.3 Wireless Earbuds HD Deep Bass Stereo Sound Isolation IPX7 Waterproof Earphones for Workout Running Sports",$15.98,4.3 out of 5 stars,"10,340","I continue to love this brand and particular model.  The tech used by this product has been copied hundreds of times and you will find multiple variations available for sale.  I've bought several, and this one is the best.  The main differences are the way the bud stays secured in your ear, the type of USB connector to plug into the charging cord, and (oddly) whether the British woman's voice says ""YOUR HEADPHONES ARE CONNECTED"" or just ""CONNECTED"".  (They all say ""BATTERY LOW"" in the same manner, so that's just a strange difference.)What I like #1 is the connector.  This uses a USB-C connector, so (as the older type require) you don't have to try inserting it, realize it's upside down, turn it around, try again.What I like #2 is the way it secures.  Another design had a soft plastic mesh ""finger"" that would lock it into place on your ear, but that thing always seemed to slip out of place.  This model has the securing element built-in to the design of the earbud.  So with an easy twist forward, it's locked in.And #3, it's the full version of ""YOUR HEADPHONES ARE CONNECTED"".  Not that it's any big deal, but it seems almost like evidence that they didn't skimp, and paid the lady for 3 extra words.  (LOL, probably not)They do seem to make improvements with each updated model number.  There are a couple of tactile elements to the design that make it easier to identify where the button is (for pause/play, etc.).I don't actually use these sitting up or running, however.  My use is predominantly for bedtime white noise.  (I have a particular gentle-thunderstorm track that plays on repeat all night long.)  I'm a side sleeper, so any time I get up to shift sides, I swap one bud in, the other out, and just leave the other bud loose at the edge of the pillow.  It works well for this purpose.But I'm replacing a prior model where I must have squashed the free bud, and after about a year, something got sensitive and started shorting out the sound.  (no visible cord or bud damage, so it could have been ordinary device failure)  But for the price, it didn't upset me.  We'll see how this holds up over the year, but so far, it's all good.Sound quality is good, going plenty loud enough (for my purposes anyway).  I tend to dislike heavy bass (which causes permanent hearing loss anyway), and this doesn't really have that, so it's a good match for ME.  If you wanted that low-end inner-ear-damaging bass, this won't really deliver.  (I already pay the price for my youth with constant tinnitus -- kids, take care of your hearing!  The loud ringing 24/7 for the rest of your life seriously sucks. -- And no, the tinnitus is not because I listen to quiet rain sounds all night long, they are on low volume, and I had it long before starting to do this - the rain sounds are just to calm my thoughts.)Speaking of which, it has a good seal on your ear that really does help block noise.  (Sometimes I'm so tired that I forget to start the rain track, and it does a good job blocking those insects and highway noises.)Read more"

"TOZO Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds, 6 Mics ENC Clear Call, IPX8 Waterproof, in Ear Bluetooth 5.3 Headphones Stereo Bass Ear Buds 59H Playtime with LED Display 32 EQs via APP",$27.98,4.4 out of 5 stars,"7,898","I loved my T6s; they lasted a long, long time and I was sad to give them up but I was willing to give these a try. Holy crap, these are amazing! They did everything the T6s did, but more and better. They also address some of the issues I had with the T6s - no disconnections and reconnections during phone calls, no erroneously varying tap sensitivity, no connections while in the charging case. These issues were minor and I was certainly willing to live with them given the quality of sound and ease of use of the T6 but I was very happy to see these corrected in newer models.The NC9‚Äôs have three modes - normal, for a little external noise with no variation in sound frequency (for quiet environments), transparency, for allowing external sounds when situational awareness is necessitated (for keeping track of kids or pets or ensuring safety while working in an environment where you may need to respond to hazards or danger), and noise-cancelling (great for droning machinery and traffic). They come out of the charging case in normal mode and you can activate transparency with a single tap on the left, switch between transparency and noise cancelling with another single tap, and then a triple tap will take you back to normal mode, very competently designed by someone who understood that you may want to switch between modes quickly and easily for safety concerns. I‚Äôve had a chance to try all of these in different environments. Holding my hand out to the side and snapping my fingers (and I‚Äôm a loud snapper lol), the normal mode allows for a little sound to come through. The transparency mode boosts the treble of the sound, allowing me to discern both the type of sound and its direction. The noise cancelling reduces the sound to almost nothing. I use all three of these on walks at night - I live in a busy city with crazy drivers and with a single tap, I can activate transparency mode while at a crosswalk or walking down a dark alley to make sure no one is sneaking up on me (or running a red light), and then tap again for noise-cancelling once I‚Äôm in a safer area, and take it back to normal mode if I‚Äôm in a quieter location without danger. Same thing in the shower, where I‚Äôve usually got them in noise-cancelling - it‚Äôs very easy to tap if I think I‚Äôve heard a knock on the door or my rabbits causing trouble, just to make sure no one‚Äôs gonna come in and Psycho me. They also don‚Äôt seem to be affected by hot water, so you don‚Äôt need to worry about your shower adjusting your volume for you, which is great my shower has no idea how loud or soft I want my Pink Floyd. Transparency and noise-cancelling both maintain a very high sound quality, just with added features.The NC9s are fantastic for both the music I listen to and videos I watch! They‚Äôre excellent with hard rock and rap, with vibrant bass and treble and clear dictation with vocals, and I love that they bring out instruments usually buried in the mixes of the classical music I enjoy, definitely better than your average earbud. Like, if the mixing is good, you‚Äôre gonna hear all sorts of stuff you may have missed before! If the mixing is bad, well, it was gonna sound not-so-good anyways, but now you‚Äôll be able to articulate why and what you‚Äôre missing, and it‚Äôll probably still sound a little better.With podcasts or video essays, there is clear distinction between speech, music, and added clips in the sound and I‚Äôve learned so much about the creator‚Äôs whose content I enjoy! Who knew video essayists breathed so much? I mean obviously I guess people are always breathing but I‚Äôve just never noticed it before! I caught you!The battery lasts quite a long time, accurate to the assessment on the product page. I‚Äôve been wearing them for long hours since I got them on last week and I haven‚Äôt needed to charge the case yet, which is another bonus on the T6, which I thought did a great job lasting but these can go quite a bit longer. I haven‚Äôt had them run low on battery yet, probably because I pop them in the case every time I take them off, but they also have an auto-shut-off if there‚Äôs no music playing so if you just set them down, they‚Äôre not going to run their batteries down. The interface with the exact battery percentage is also a plus - it keeps track of the charging case and an approximation of each individual earbud so you know when they‚Äôre ready to go, another plus from the T6 where you just kind of had to guess and hope they were actually charged and didn‚Äôt just jostle off the charger.They‚Äôre very comfortable; they don‚Äôt press on my piercings (I have a daith and conch on one side and they fit perfectly fine and stay in place, I love that they vibe with my alternative, quirky-girly lifestyle lol) and they don‚Äôt bother my weirdly shaped ear canals haha I‚Äôve had so many issues with other in-ear headphones causing earaches and I gave these a workout the other day with 12 hours of wear and they felt just fine.Two (very minor) drawbacks for some people:1. You have to tap pretty quickly to transition between modes and features. I don‚Äôt consider this much of an issue, since I have neurological issues and usually I have a problem with tapping too fast for earbuds to register or too many times for the features I want, it just took a day or so to get used to not having to adjust my tremble for my headphones. But on that note, kudos to whoever designed the user interactivity because they clearly had tap-errors (too many, too few, too quickly, too slowly) in mind. I mean that no error you make causes any trouble that you can‚Äôt fix with a few additional taps, so no power-offs or disconnections or activating a feature far different than the one you meant. For example, to answer a phone call, it‚Äôs one tap on the left or right, but to dismiss a phone call, you have to hold for a whole 2 seconds, meaning it‚Äôs very unlikely you‚Äôre going to accidentally hang up. To raise or lower the volume, it‚Äôs hold for 2 seconds on the right or left respectively, but if you tap for a little less than 2 seconds, you‚Äôll just activate transparency/noise-cancelling on the left (1 or 3 taps to fix) or pause the sound on the right (1 tap to fix). It‚Äôs not gonna skip around (next - 2 taps, right; previous - 2 taps, left) or activate voice assistance (3 taps, right), or disconnect or power them off. Very intuitive! Any mistake you make is related to what you meant to do, and easily fixable! There aren‚Äôt too many instructions to memorize, which is great because I have a tiny brain! :D2. The sounds quality is kind of intense, so if you‚Äôre sensitive to crisp or rich tones, maybe start a little quieter like I had to. I definitely have some sort of auditory processing troubles, like, sometimes sounds become garbled or sharp or buzzy  or shrill or fade into the void without me realizing, so suddenly hearing my favorite streamer‚Äôs keyboard go clack-clack-clackity-clack when I‚Äôd never heard it before was almost a little spooky! Like, when I say you‚Äôll hear seemingly EVERYTHING, I mean it! For most people, including the couple I let try these out, that‚Äôs a huge bonus - they‚Äôre big music and podcast people and loved all the additional sounds that felt closer to them than ever. (Also they do not have any APD, so hearing a quiet breath or keyboard clack didn‚Äôt bother them at all, so in all honesty, that might just be a me thing) But for the first few hours of wearing them, it was a little overwhelming for me! After I got used to it though, I really appreciate the quality. It‚Äôs made listening to my favorite pieces a joy all over again, and I‚Äôm really glad I stuck with them! I love hearing every piccolo squeal and bassoon honk on the tracks now, and with the sounds being more clear, I‚Äôve noticed they‚Äôre not fading into the background as much as with my old headphones, when I could go almost an hour forgetting I‚Äôm even listening to something until it ends. All that to say, if you‚Äôre used to a more muted, blended experience, prepare to have your mind blown (and maybe turn the volume down just a tad for your first few hours, that worked for me at least :) )And that‚Äôs it! Yeah, these are awesome! Thank you so much TOZO! I feel so much cooler with my fancy new earbuds, and I hope anyone reading this loves them as much as I do! Best in-ear earphones ever!Read more"

"PHILIPS H6509 Wireless Headphones,Over-Ear Bluetooth Headphones with Noise Canceling Pro,Dynamic Bass,70H Battery Life,Fast Charging,Soft Ear Cups,Bluetooth 5.3, Multipoint Connectivity,App Control",$49.99,4.2 out of 5 stars,856,"First off, it's important to note that these headphones fill a niche: somebody who wants an over-ear style closed-back headset that has some degree of water/dust resistance (in this case, IP55). They probably shouldn't be the only pair of headphones you own and use. These are ideal for exercise (since they can handle sweat) or anywhere they might get hit with drops of rain or sand. You can even use them in the bathtub without worry of splashing on them (unlike most other over-ear sets), but be very careful not to submerge or drop them in the water.If you don't need the water resistance, you can find better audio quality and comfort. For home listening, I'd suggest springing a bit more for a comfortable open-back headset set, and for casual listening outside the house, high quality earbuds (which I'd also suggest springing a bit more for) are still ideal. However, my problem with earbuds is that when exercising, my ear canals tend to tighten up and they become extremely uncomfortable. This set is built to stay on your head while exercising, so it can feel a bit tight after a couple hours, but the earpads have a soft ""cooling gel"" that is better than other sets I've used, and it definitely gets more comfortable after a short break-in period. As an added bonus, the pads are removable and the outer lining is washable (although they feel pretty durable, I'm curious to see how long they last). The headband has a strip of rubber to soften the pressure, but it does feel a bit too hard and some comfort improvements could be made there. On the other hand, it feels built like a tank - they're light on your head, but still feel extremely durable. Other bonuses include a standard audio jack as an option instead of Bluetooth, big sturdy volume control buttons that aren't a pain to use like most headset controls, and an insane battery that lasts ages (I got at least the manufacturer spec of 35 hours, using them 2-3 hours a day for nearly two weeks without needing to recharge).These weren't the first pair of water-resistant cans I bought from Phillips. The previous version was the SH402, which I bought based on goodwill coming from their excellent X2 headphones I've used for years. These were an absolute travesty, with buzzing out of one side and audio quality that sounded like somebody playing music under a couch in the next room with the door closed, and I'd never returned something so fast. The A4216 set VASTLY improves on these, with very good audio quality. It's still not top-tier in the pure audio department or anything - it's a bit overly bassy with a hint of a muffled quality in the way a lot of closed-back headsets that are built to prevent audio leakage are - but it's more than good enough as a minor compromise to balance out the other benefits this set has (especially for the reasonable price), and again, if you don't need an exercise/water-resistant headset, you'd probably want to look elsewhere anyway. If you happen to be in that particular market though, I'm not sure you can really do much better than these.Read more"

The sound quality is way better than I expected‚Äîclear vocals, good treble, and surprisingly deep bass. Music actually sounds full and balanced, and I can hear a lot of detail. Whether I‚Äôm listening to music or taking calls, the audio is clear and strong.Battery life is a big win here. I get close to 9 hours on a single charge, and the case holds enough power to last for several more full charges‚Äîaround 48 hours total, which is more than enough for a few days without charging. The little LED display showing how much battery is left is a nice touch too.Comfort-wise, these are very lightweight and easy to wear. I‚Äôve used them while walking, working out, and even just doing stuff around the house. They stay in place and don‚Äôt bother my ears, even after wearing them for a long time. The included ear tips come in different sizes so it‚Äôs easy to find a good fit.Bluetooth connection is fast and stable. I just open the case and they connect right away. No dropouts or weird glitches. The touch controls work well once you get the hang of them‚Äîtakes a little practice to avoid hitting the wrong command, but nothing too frustrating.One more thing I really appreciate is the waterproofing. I‚Äôve used them during workouts and in light rain without any issues. It‚Äôs good peace of mind knowing they‚Äôre built to handle a bit of sweat or water.Overall, for the price, these earbuds are a great buy. Reliable, good sound, long battery life, and very easy to use. Definitely worth picking up if you want quality wireless earbuds without spending a fortune.Read more"
"Sony WI-C100 Wireless in-Ear Bluetooth Headphones with Built-in Microphone, Black",$23.00,4.2 out of 5 stars,"11,633","I've used its cousin, the WI-C130, for the past two years and felt like it was about time to replace them given their waning battery life. I've used those out and about, listening to music and, most importantly, while lying in bed listening to audiobooks (including side-sleeping). Most earphones aren't comfortable for that; either they poke out too much, are generally uncomfortable, or too loose/unsecure. But these (both C100 and C130) are amazingly comfortable for that use-case.The WI-C100 is comparable to WI-C130. Given Sony's notoriously confusing naming scheme, its not clear which of the models is meant to be a step-up over the other.- In minor aspects of build quality, the WI-C130 seems better; slightly better quality plastic with magnets (at least weak ones) on the eartips for convenient attaching when not in use.- But otherwise, the WI-C100 seems better; the sound quality (from initial impressions) and the availability of software preferences. E.g., after initial connection with an android smartphone, it prompts you to install the Sony SoundConnect app which has a nice equalizer with a ""clear bass"" option. It also includes helpful guides on the button functionality and choosing the right sized eartips for your ears. It also includes (what seems like) a gimmick feature: a ""360 live sound"" app which simulates surround sound and adapts it to a model of your ear shape. I'm not sure whether this applies globally, or only in the small collection of paid bloatware apps it offers to install. The app could've been more polished, and if the 360 live sound thingy was better implemented, it would definitely outcompete other such branded apps.Two important shortcomings:- These should've had multipoint bluetooth connections so that at least two devices could be connected at a time. It seems they could've implemented that in this package, esp. at this price-point.- These don't automatically turn off after a timeout period when there's no sound. I suspect this needlessly shortens their battery health overtime, like it does for the WI-C130, especially when used during sleep time. Its a shame because an automatic-switch-off feature would've made these even more robust and long-lasting.TL;DR: In the relatively overlooked niche of wireless neckband earphones, this is a very decent, economical option, providing Sony-level sound quality and reliability.(Having said that, the WI-C130s were $18 two years ago, now these comparable WI-C100s are almost double the price. That's regrettable especially since the cheap plastic build quality is nothing to write home about, also with the two shortcomings above. There are other companies providing more features at this price-point (albeit without the Sony-level comfort). I hope Sony limits price-hikes for these and related models, or at least justifies them with tangible improvements in build quality, sound, IP rating, battery life, QoL features, etc).Bonus tip: cross the earphones around the neck for a more secure fit. This advice goes for most wireless earphones with neckbands.Read more"

"Sennheiser Consumer Audio Momentum 4 Wireless Headphones - Bluetooth Headset for Crystal-Clear Calls with Adaptive Noise Cancellation, 60h Battery Life, Customizable Sound, White (509267)",$265.95,4.0 out of 5 stars,"7,609","5 stars to me. 4 stars all around for the average consumer due to issues I believe others will find a problem with but I have found some workarounds forI will start off with the flaws (unfortunately it has em) from my experience and some solutions. They are mostly features based. I'll also address confusions and ""negative"" experiences as there are reviews where clearly it's the people and not the headphones that are the problem yet they are giving this a worse impression that it should have. And lastly praise what it has going well for itAlso, I will highly suggest downloading the new app version called smart control PLUS and install any firmware updates. Then go adjust settings or it will have some annoyances.FlawsOn-head detection: this causes most of the headaches. For those that like to free up an ear to listen to someone talk better - make a habit of freeing your left ear and not the right. There is a sensor to detect your ear and it is only INSIDE the right earcup.  It makes a double click noise when it detects and stops detecting your ear. Unfortunately it makes a similar sound for both which is a huge flaw as you might not know if it is detecting or not sometimes. This will trigger the auto off feature if it doesn't detect you while you're listening to music. It usually pauses from the headset, but there is a possibility it can be ignored by an app and continue playing so when you put it back on you might not even know if it detected you. Another possibility is you made the mistake of pressing play from the app itself when it stops detecting you thus eventually triggering the sleep feature. You can disable auto off but I personally put it in 1 hour just in case as I would have likely readjusted my headset by that point and reset it. This goes into the next feature: auto play. It's perfectly fine on mobile but on PC it can be a nightmare as you could be listening to music, you adjust your right earcup so it pauses and when you put it back on, it might play some other video like youtube in an open browser; it depends on the programs that behave to bluetooth pause/play. So don't have so many open video/audio programs in the background. Also for those with long hair, autoplay can struggle to detect if it completely covers your right ear (some people start to think it stopped working). Overall, I just disabled autoplay while keeping auto-off enabled as I mainly use the M4 on PC, but again, it seems to work really well on mobile. Plus of course if any of these aren't necessary to you, you can simply disable it as a whole for an old fashioned headphone experience to avoid annoyances but I have gotten used to it at this point that I rarely have issues [Update: I just learned on May 2025 that as of the new firmware 2.13.42 it reads ""Improved auto-off behavior reducing unexpected behavior during calls or streaming due to misdetection in smart pause sensor"", so perhaps this section might become untrue with less flaws down the road thus hopefully improving user experience]Multi- point connection: It can and will connect to two devices that have bluetooth active after they have been paired. There are individuals that pair their headphones to everything and might experience a random connection. Unfortunately no disabling this so you have to be precise with what you want to connect this with. I only paired this to PC and mobile so it doesn't attempt to connect to anything else but in the app you can click to what else in the list want to connect to (or delete). When it detects multiple signals it will prioritize connecting to what you last used, it seems. Not an issue for me. Also, it will ALWAYS prioritize audio for the first connection of the two which will usually be the phone. This is important. If it connects to my phone first, well lets say Im on the PC listening to music, once your phone makes any kind of sound, your audio will switch to it and interrupt the music, then resume playing your PC's music. Because of this, disable useless sounds like the lock screen opening sounds because that will trigger a switch (not sure about typing sounds). I have sound on for notifications to get my attention for the phone but if that is an annoyance I would try connecting other devices (like PC) as your main device first and then phone second. That way, it will ONLY play audio on the main device (PC) in spite of your phone making noises or playing audio. I tend to disable phone bluetooth, so it isn't an issue for me what connects first anyways. Now, this is a major flaw which may have been addressed in the new firmware update and app but I have not fully tested yet so this is based on months old experience. Last flaw with this. Do not have constant audio playing on -BOTH- devices because it will cause some static to what you are listening to. No idea why this happens but sometimes the music sounds glitchy and I realize it's because my PC is playing music alongside my phone. All it takes is not having something like music playing on the second device and it gets clean.Reboot: it can be done on the power button after holding for over 15 seconds. Be careful NOT to do this if it is not your intention. I have a friend who accidentally did thisHigh resolution: app is glitched if you try to do personalized sound after enabling high resolution. It will ask you to disable high resolution before proceeding. All you have to do is go to standard mode, make your sound profile, then go back and enable High Resolution.Confusions:ANC: some people complain you can't turn off ANC. You sort of can. Old app, on the ANC slide, you put the slider in the middle. Most importantly, the new version of the app now allows to turn off ANC and might possibly increase your battery life. Oh, and some people remark of ANC randomly activating when outside. That is the wind noise reduction activating during air blowing directly to your mics. You can turn it off in ANC settings (you can also adjust transparency during phone calls there) but trust me that you don't want to hear wind transmitted into a headsetAuto-answer calls: complaints on this but another reason you need the app to disable it if you don't want it.Aut-connect: some complain that if it moves it will auto connect or cause confusion when they don't know why their bluetooth loud speakers stopped working until they realize the headphones are connected. I personally love auto connect and has never been an issue. I put my headphones away where it won't move at all and once I grab it, boom, just straightforward and smooth connection grab and go. This is a feature of auto off so if you don't want it to be doing this you can either disable auto off (more like sleep) or turn off the headphones directly from the power button (which means you will also have to turn it back on with the button). I don't think of it as a flaw to be honestDiscord/meeting calls: This is a big one. There are people mentioning how when they get on discord, their music and game sounds muffled. That is its hands free activating because it believes you are in a call. It prioritizes the call once it is activating its mic. You may have noticed it on your phone before too with music getting muffled. Problem is these then get compared directly to a gaming headset. Most gaming headsets have a usb dongle. Those dongles are designed to give both high quality low latency audio and mic signals at the same time. These? They are bluetooth headsets not specifically designed for gaming but rather for high quality audio. This is not a major fault of the headset. There exists a workaround for this but you will have to disable handsfree and rely on a different mic (which can be a far superior option anyways). To do this - on windows 11, go to settings. Click ""bluetooth & devices"". Then click on ""view more devices"" up top to go to a drop down list of devices. Scroll all the way down until you find ""more devices and printer settings"". Find the M4 headset, right click and go to properties. Click on the hardware tab. On this list, look for Name ""Momentum 4 Hands-Free"" that is under Type ""Sound, Video..."". Click once on it then click on properties below. In properties, General tab, click on the blue and yellow shield that says Change Settings. Then go to the Driver tab and Click Disable Driver. Reboot PC. Can be undone in similar method. At this point it has no headset mic active ~specifically~ on the PC (phone should be unaffected) so audio will be clear but now an external mic will be needed.Experiences:Connectivity: people say they have connectivity issues but thankfully it is very rare for me. It has a good distance to it too. I keep up to date with everything on my phoneTouchpad: some say it is very sensitive. It is certainly more sensitive than usual but there are exaggerations to it. My hair does not trigger it. Turning my head does not trigger it. I don't trigger it with a hoodie on. I don't wear beanies over it (why would you?) so I cant say anything there. Stretching my arms above my head might trigger and laying my head on the right side might make it think you want to change volume or transparency. But some of these reviews are funny. They are not rated to be water resistant at all (like most headsets) so if rain drops trigger it, actually no, WHY DO YOU EVEN HAVE IT IN THE RAIN?App: the app is fine minus the glitch [refer to High Resolution in Flaws] and has only been improving bit by bit. There's now also a new version which requires a new download that will likely be getting more of a focus onDurability: it is plastic which makes it lighter but thankfully I have not broken anything. I have bumped it into things, dropped it once. I try to treat is as glass so these are rare occurrences. I would not work out in these due to the fact they are not designed to deal with liquid. If problems occur because you work out in these, well that's your fault, but there exist rubber sweat covers to put over the padding to help out a bit. The Sennheisers Momentum 4/Sport earbuds I believe have water resistance and might be worth a look instead if you need a true gym companionStrengthsAudio quality: right out of the box, they are great. It has a neutral sound profile while having some attention to bass. There are presets in the app that are decent and it really does not need a bass booster but it exists. To be honest, I would skip everything and go straight for the sound personalization feature in the app. It's very simple to adjust, uses mostly sliders while you listen to audio. And once you are done it will create a setting that somehow manages to be far superior than what's already available in the app. It just cleans up the sound so much more to your liking; the difference is bewildering. Ever since that point, I have not listened to music the same. Just when I thought I was getting bored of music, these revived that love to want to listen to everything again and also motivated me to listen to things I never did before. There is literally pre-Sennheiser and during-Sennheiser eras to me now and am curious to their wired headsets. One thing that will become super noticeable is its soundstage. It spreads the instruments to a degree where you can notice more of everything. Albeit, this can be discombobulating and bassheads might not like the lack of sharp precision but this isn't meant to be your average linear listening experience (the Accentum Plus offers this at a much lower price). To give an example: What is Life by George Harrison. I might prefer it on the more linear style I am used to but these can separate things to the point where it is also directional and you can feel like you are standing at a concert and George is directly in the middle of it all in front of you so it feels more real- similar to as if you are becoming conscious of your own breathing. And in midst of all the chaos, you can still clearly hear George's voice and you notice ALL of the instruments more. It first gave me goosebumps how much it changed the song. Some songs are designed to be ""linear"" which could possibly affect emotional type of songs negatively but from a musical perspective, my goodness it is incredible. Now I just go back to see what music I am used to that changes with these (hint: a lot). Electronic/hip-hop music perhaps is the exception but this gives such clarity to detail that it is still a great listen- one thing is for sure these headsets love when there is a band setup (Bjork, the Roots, Gorillaz, etc). Sound quality is the biggest reason you go for these.Comfort: I can go on for a while without my ears hurting or anything. Also these don't heat up much and has proper adjustability for bigger headsLook: I have the black with copper ring and they are absolutely gorgeous. I question the longevity of the cloth on the headstrap but it makes it more beautiful than it has any business being for a plastic headsetFeatures: ANC is better than I expected. It does its job, and though it might not lead in this category, the differences are so small compared to the competition. Also drowned out what I needed it to during plane trips. And hearthrough, although I have had better, they will more than suffice to the point where I rarely have any issues hearing people. The fact that it is good at both of these is amazing for value.Battery: they can go up to nearly 60 hours, especially in standard mode. Not an exaggeration. I can go days without charging them. For this quality of headset, I don't think much of the competition comes close to this. In fact this is the mind blowing part because most other bluetooth headsets don't sound anywhere as good as these and they have half the battery life if not worse. No fears when travelling that it will die on me. In fact, it lasted me an entire week's tripSurprisesGaming: it has low enough latency. Combine that with that very clean audio and surprising directional audio this already has and wow, it performs quite well. I can actually spot details better and sometimes extra details I wasn't aware like I remember distinctly many months ago when I played Paladins, not only was I able to hear behind a wall slightly above me, but I realized it was subtle high heel sounds. I am not saying this will replace top of the line gaming headsets like steel series but if you have these and not a gaming headset, these will more than suffice.Charging: I was already enamored by the battery life but the fact is, it handles charging nearly as well. You can get hours worth per 10 minutes of charging and around an hour and a half or so it will be fully charged. That may not sound great but half of that will net you 30 hours of life which is STILL more than the competition. And the other surprise was that I accidentally discovered on the PC that you can still use it while charging - it simply appears as a different sound output you have to switch to. I thought it was weird how multiple momentum 4's appeared but when I clicked the other output, music started booming through it again. I was shocked. It already has a super long battery life with quick charging. It doesn't need it yet it has it. I have never had a headset that allows that with USB-C. Sennheiser were practically showing off at this point. So I would get a super long cable to make this comfortable during charging if you think this is a feature you will be usingThese are already the greatest -bluetooth- headsets I have ever owned under the $500 mark. I have tried out direct competitors Airpods Max (best hearthrough and good clean quality) and Sony Xm5's (amazing features and stylish) but the M4 felt like a no brainer. The max have poor battery life (under 20 hours) meanwhile these can reach close to triple that. The XM5's are light and so smooth with their features and touchpad (I loved speak to chat) but their fragility comes into question as they are notorious for the hinges breaking no matter how good you take care of them while the M4's mostly have earpads wearing down (easily replaceable). Meanwhile, guess what? The M4's imo sound better than both of them, are more comfortable than both, and can be found MUCH cheaper than both as I have seen it as low as $190. Even if, say, the Bowers & Wilkins PX8 might have slightly better audio and a better build, it's not a major difference so it is imo horrifically overpriced while this just has much higher value after sales and is an easier recommendationOverall, it absolutely bothers me just how overrated the other headsets on Amazon usually are meanwhile these get a bad impression. If you are a fan of music and you want to improve that experience with the bluetooth format at great affordability, it doesn't get better than theseRead more"

I‚Äôm thrilled with my choice‚Äîthese earbuds have exceeded my expectations in every way!Comfort: These are incredibly comfortable, even during extended wear. The open-ear design sits lightly in the ear without any pressure or discomfort, making them perfect for long listening sessions, whether I‚Äôm working, walking, or relaxing. They stay securely in place without needing constant adjustments, which was a pleasant surprise for a non-rubber-tip design.Sound Quality: The audio is fantastic for the price point.

They don‚Äôt block out all ambient noise, which I actually appreciate for staying aware of my surroundings.Connectivity: Pairing was a breeze. They connected to my phone in seconds via Bluetooth, with no hiccups or dropouts during use. The connection remains stable even when I‚Äôm moving around the house or walking outdoors. Switching between devices is also seamless.Design and Build: These earbuds are featherlight, which adds to their comfort and makes them easy to carry. The build feels sturdy enough for daily use, and the charging case is compact and convenient.

They combine comfort, great sound, and reliable performance in a lightweight package. If you‚Äôre looking for an alternative to rubber-tipped earbuds or just want a reliable pair for everyday use, I highly recommend giving these a try.

Advertising something at a reduced price and as improved and then removing the one recommended cable from the included items list is the most dishonest things a seller can do so even if these headphones are of the best quality and I doubt that they are I would still give them a one star, even a 0 star if I could! I don‚Äôt recommend theses headphones to anyone!(Update)  After ordering a Digital optical cable for these headphones and finally getting to try them I can say that the sound is very good, the comfort of wearing them is excellent because I wear them once a day for four hours in the evening wile watching my tv. Because I have lost 64 percent of my hearing headphones have become an important part of watching my tv because I have received complaints from my neighbors about the volume.Shortly after purchasing the cable a received an email from the seller regarding the missing cable and Winni was very apologetic about the issue. It is unfortunate that a company cannot rely on their employees to do their job correctly and see too it that all of the components that are included with the product are indeed in the package. Although there could be many reasons for the mishap others than employee‚Äôs failure to do their job there‚Äôs still no excuse for missing parts. I recommend theses headphones because they are of good quality; maybe not as good as a $400. 00 pair of theater headphones but for the money they are great headphones.Update 4/19/24 I did not mention in my review that I have gone through several pairs of wireless headphones in the past and have not been very impressed with the quality and longevity of any of them and I paid over $200.00 for every one of them with the exception of these headphones. My biggest complaint is that none of them held a charge for more than 8 hours the other is none of them were comfortable. With that being said I have put these headphones to the test right away. I used them for four hours a night for four days and the still have a good enough charge to keep going although it is not recommended to drain the batteries completely so I put them back on the charger after the forth night. I am sure that the reason for this is that the headphones have an off on switch which none of the more expensive ones that I have bought did so I give them a üëç for the initiative to add such a good sense accessory. The other thing that I have noticed is that I don‚Äôt have a headache and irritated scalp after wearing them for four hours a night. Only time will tell but if these headaches last two years they will have out lasted all of my other more expensive ones and sound just as good if not better than the all the more expensive one and more comfortable than all the more expressive ones. So my question would be, why buy the more expensive ones?Read more"

"Sennheiser Consumer Audio Momentum 4 Wireless Headphones - Bluetooth Headset for Crystal-Clear Calls with Adaptive Noise Cancellation, 60h Battery Life, Customizable Sound, White (509267)",$265.95,4.0 out of 5 stars,"7,609","5 stars to me. 4 stars all around for the average consumer due to issues I believe others will find a problem with but I have found some workarounds forI will start off with the flaws (unfortunately it has em) from my experience and some solutions. They are mostly features based. I'll also address confusions and ""negative"" experiences as there are reviews where clearly it's the people and not the headphones that are the problem yet they are giving this a worse impression that it should have. And lastly praise what it has going well for itAlso, I will highly suggest downloading the new app version called smart control PLUS and install any firmware updates. Then go adjust settings or it will have some annoyances.FlawsOn-head detection: this causes most of the headaches. For those that like to free up an ear to listen to someone talk better - make a habit of freeing your left ear and not the right. There is a sensor to detect your ear and it is only INSIDE the right earcup.  It makes a double click noise when it detects and stops detecting your ear. Unfortunately it makes a similar sound for both which is a huge flaw as you might not know if it is detecting or not sometimes. This will trigger the auto off feature if it doesn't detect you while you're listening to music. It usually pauses from the headset, but there is a possibility it can be ignored by an app and continue playing so when you put it back on you might not even know if it detected you. Another possibility is you made the mistake of pressing play from the app itself when it stops detecting you thus eventually triggering the sleep feature. You can disable auto off but I personally put it in 1 hour just in case as I would have likely readjusted my headset by that point and reset it. This goes into the next feature: auto play. It's perfectly fine on mobile but on PC it can be a nightmare as you could be listening to music, you adjust your right earcup so it pauses and when you put it back on, it might play some other video like youtube in an open browser; it depends on the programs that behave to bluetooth pause/play. So don't have so many open video/audio programs in the background. Also for those with long hair, autoplay can struggle to detect if it completely covers your right ear (some people start to think it stopped working). Overall, I just disabled autoplay while keeping auto-off enabled as I mainly use the M4 on PC, but again, it seems to work really well on mobile. Plus of course if any of these aren't necessary to you, you can simply disable it as a whole for an old fashioned headphone experience to avoid annoyances but I have gotten used to it at this point that I rarely have issues [Update: I just learned on May 2025 that as of the new firmware 2.13.42 it reads ""Improved auto-off behavior reducing unexpected behavior during calls or streaming due to misdetection in smart pause sensor"", so perhaps this section might become untrue with less flaws down the road thus hopefully improving user experience]Multi- point connection: It can and will connect to two devices that have bluetooth active after they have been paired. There are individuals that pair their headphones to everything and might experience a random connection. Unfortunately no disabling this so you have to be precise with what you want to connect this with. I only paired this to PC and mobile so it doesn't attempt to connect to anything else but in the app you can click to what else in the list want to connect to (or delete). When it detects multiple signals it will prioritize connecting to what you last used, it seems. Not an issue for me. Also, it will ALWAYS prioritize audio for the first connection of the two which will usually be the phone. This is important. If it connects to my phone first, well lets say Im on the PC listening to music, once your phone makes any kind of sound, your audio will switch to it and interrupt the music, then resume playing your PC's music. Because of this, disable useless sounds like the lock screen opening sounds because that will trigger a switch (not sure about typing sounds). I have sound on for notifications to get my attention for the phone but if that is an annoyance I would try connecting other devices (like PC) as your main device first and then phone second. That way, it will ONLY play audio on the main device (PC) in spite of your phone making noises or playing audio. I tend to disable phone bluetooth, so it isn't an issue for me what connects first anyways. Now, this is a major flaw which may have been addressed in the new firmware update and app but I have not fully tested yet so this is based on months old experience. Last flaw with this. Do not have constant audio playing on -BOTH- devices because it will cause some static to what you are listening to. No idea why this happens but sometimes the music sounds glitchy and I realize it's because my PC is playing music alongside my phone. All it takes is not having something like music playing on the second device and it gets clean.Reboot: it can be done on the power button after holding for over 15 seconds. Be careful NOT to do this if it is not your intention. I have a friend who accidentally did thisHigh resolution: app is glitched if you try to do personalized sound after enabling high resolution. It will ask you to disable high resolution before proceeding. All you have to do is go to standard mode, make your sound profile, then go back and enable High Resolution.Confusions:ANC: some people complain you can't turn off ANC. You sort of can. Old app, on the ANC slide, you put the slider in the middle. Most importantly, the new version of the app now allows to turn off ANC and might possibly increase your battery life. Oh, and some people remark of ANC randomly activating when outside. That is the wind noise reduction activating during air blowing directly to your mics. You can turn it off in ANC settings (you can also adjust transparency during phone calls there) but trust me that you don't want to hear wind transmitted into a headsetAuto-answer calls: complaints on this but another reason you need the app to disable it if you don't want it.Aut-connect: some complain that if it moves it will auto connect or cause confusion when they don't know why their bluetooth loud speakers stopped working until they realize the headphones are connected. I personally love auto connect and has never been an issue. I put my headphones away where it won't move at all and once I grab it, boom, just straightforward and smooth connection grab and go. This is a feature of auto off so if you don't want it to be doing this you can either disable auto off (more like sleep) or turn off the headphones directly from the power button (which means you will also have to turn it back on with the button). I don't think of it as a flaw to be honestDiscord/meeting calls: This is a big one. There are people mentioning how when they get on discord, their music and game sounds muffled. That is its hands free activating because it believes you are in a call. It prioritizes the call once it is activating its mic. You may have noticed it on your phone before too with music getting muffled. Problem is these then get compared directly to a gaming headset. Most gaming headsets have a usb dongle. Those dongles are designed to give both high quality low latency audio and mic signals at the same time. These? They are bluetooth headsets not specifically designed for gaming but rather for high quality audio. This is not a major fault of the headset. There exists a workaround for this but you will have to disable handsfree and rely on a different mic (which can be a far superior option anyways). To do this - on windows 11, go to settings. Click ""bluetooth & devices"". Then click on ""view more devices"" up top to go to a drop down list of devices. Scroll all the way down until you find ""more devices and printer settings"". Find the M4 headset, right click and go to properties. Click on the hardware tab. On this list, look for Name ""Momentum 4 Hands-Free"" that is under Type ""Sound, Video..."". Click once on it then click on properties below. In properties, General tab, click on the blue and yellow shield that says Change Settings. Then go to the Driver tab and Click Disable Driver. Reboot PC. Can be undone in similar method. At this point it has no headset mic active ~specifically~ on the PC (phone should be unaffected) so audio will be clear but now an external mic will be needed.Experiences:Connectivity: people say they have connectivity issues but thankfully it is very rare for me. It has a good distance to it too. I keep up to date with everything on my phoneTouchpad: some say it is very sensitive. It is certainly more sensitive than usual but there are exaggerations to it. My hair does not trigger it. Turning my head does not trigger it. I don't trigger it with a hoodie on. I don't wear beanies over it (why would you?) so I cant say anything there. Stretching my arms above my head might trigger and laying my head on the right side might make it think you want to change volume or transparency. But some of these reviews are funny. They are not rated to be water resistant at all (like most headsets) so if rain drops trigger it, actually no, WHY DO YOU EVEN HAVE IT IN THE RAIN?App: the app is fine minus the glitch [refer to High Resolution in Flaws] and has only been improving bit by bit. There's now also a new version which requires a new download that will likely be getting more of a focus onDurability: it is plastic which makes it lighter but thankfully I have not broken anything. I have bumped it into things, dropped it once. I try to treat is as glass so these are rare occurrences. I would not work out in these due to the fact they are not designed to deal with liquid. If problems occur because you work out in these, well that's your fault, but there exist rubber sweat covers to put over the padding to help out a bit. The Sennheisers Momentum 4/Sport earbuds I believe have water resistance and might be worth a look instead if you need a true gym companionStrengthsAudio quality: right out of the box, they are great. It has a neutral sound profile while having some attention to bass. There are presets in the app that are decent and it really does not need a bass booster but it exists. To be honest, I would skip everything and go straight for the sound personalization feature in the app. It's very simple to adjust, uses mostly sliders while you listen to audio. And once you are done it will create a setting that somehow manages to be far superior than what's already available in the app. It just cleans up the sound so much more to your liking; the difference is bewildering. Ever since that point, I have not listened to music the same. Just when I thought I was getting bored of music, these revived that love to want to listen to everything again and also motivated me to listen to things I never did before. There is literally pre-Sennheiser and during-Sennheiser eras to me now and am curious to their wired headsets. One thing that will become super noticeable is its soundstage. It spreads the instruments to a degree where you can notice more of everything. Albeit, this can be discombobulating and bassheads might not like the lack of sharp precision but this isn't meant to be your average linear listening experience (the Accentum Plus offers this at a much lower price). To give an example: What is Life by George Harrison. I might prefer it on the more linear style I am used to but these can separate things to the point where it is also directional and you can feel like you are standing at a concert and George is directly in the middle of it all in front of you so it feels more real- similar to as if you are becoming conscious of your own breathing. And in midst of all the chaos, you can still clearly hear George's voice and you notice ALL of the instruments more. It first gave me goosebumps how much it changed the song. Some songs are designed to be ""linear"" which could possibly affect emotional type of songs negatively but from a musical perspective, my goodness it is incredible. Now I just go back to see what music I am used to that changes with these (hint: a lot). Electronic/hip-hop music perhaps is the exception but this gives such clarity to detail that it is still a great listen- one thing is for sure these headsets love when there is a band setup (Bjork, the Roots, Gorillaz, etc). Sound quality is the biggest reason you go for these.Comfort: I can go on for a while without my ears hurting or anything. Also these don't heat up much and has proper adjustability for bigger headsLook: I have the black with copper ring and they are absolutely gorgeous. I question the longevity of the cloth on the headstrap but it makes it more beautiful than it has any business being for a plastic headsetFeatures: ANC is better than I expected. It does its job, and though it might not lead in this category, the differences are so small compared to the competition. Also drowned out what I needed it to during plane trips. And hearthrough, although I have had better, they will more than suffice to the point where I rarely have any issues hearing people. The fact that it is good at both of these is amazing for value.Battery: they can go up to nearly 60 hours, especially in standard mode. Not an exaggeration. I can go days without charging them. For this quality of headset, I don't think much of the competition comes close to this. In fact this is the mind blowing part because most other bluetooth headsets don't sound anywhere as good as these and they have half the battery life if not worse. No fears when travelling that it will die on me. In fact, it lasted me an entire week's tripSurprisesGaming: it has low enough latency. Combine that with that very clean audio and surprising directional audio this already has and wow, it performs quite well. I can actually spot details better and sometimes extra details I wasn't aware like I remember distinctly many months ago when I played Paladins, not only was I able to hear behind a wall slightly above me, but I realized it was subtle high heel sounds. I am not saying this will replace top of the line gaming headsets like steel series but if you have these and not a gaming headset, these will more than suffice.Charging: I was already enamored by the battery life but the fact is, it handles charging nearly as well.

I prefer my earbuds to be hard to notice, and even the black ones have a bright red letter ‚Äúb‚Äù in the middle.Beats Studio Buds - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096SV8SJG?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros ‚Äì Very comfortable with the same great physically ‚Äúclicky‚Äù buttons as the Beats Fit Pro.  Noise canceling seemed slightly better than average.  Great base.  Classic look.Cons ‚Äì Tested during a workout, a little bit of sweat had these sliding right out of my ear.  The case for these earbuds also was the flimsiest of any I had tested, with a very weak hinge that I was scared of breaking off within the 2 weeks of using.Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MWZHHKP?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros ‚Äì A neat feature that I noticed only in these earbuds was that it had noise amplification as well as noise cancelation.  With one swipe in the app, the surrounding sound was actually louder and clearer than it would be without the earbuds in.  Great if you are hard of hearing, or just enjoy snooping on conversations out of reach.Cons ‚Äì Similar to the Beats Studio Buds, these didn‚Äôt stay in during a workout.  They were usable, but every 10 minutes I found myself pushing them back into my ear.  And this is an opinion, but these are the ugliest earbuds out of the bunch.  The shiny black gleam made it look like a large beetle was hanging out in my ear.  No visible brand placement either, which makes them appear cheap and generic rather than the quality Samsung they are.Samsung Galaxy Buds Live - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TBM1L3S?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros ‚Äì Cost effective!  I added these to the test group because of the unique shape, and for that they are worth giving a try.  If you have small ears and do not like the rubber insert that is standard in most other earbuds, these may be perfect for you.Cons ‚Äì Poor fit for large ears.  These were tested the least of all of the buds, because the fit was so bad for my ear shape that they wouldn‚Äôt stay in if I turned my head too fast.Bose QuietComfort  - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C4KWM9T?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros ‚Äì Bose noise canceling is unmatched.  If your primary use for earbuds is to cancel out that background white noise, this is the pair for you.  The sound quality is great, not too heavy on the base.  The case for the earbuds stood out from the rest as the only one that impressed me.  Felt very study, and I had no worries tossing it into a gym bag or cup holder.  The only case with a button latch to make sure it doesn‚Äôt open accidentally.Cons ‚Äì This was the most expensive pair of earbuds by a longshot, and there were still some things I felt could be improved.  The rubber inserts had more of a ‚Äúflayed‚Äù shape rather than the ‚Äúrounded‚Äù shape that is standard.  My guess is that this was by design, because the earbuds were also slightly heavier than others and may need that extra in-ear grip.  The flayed shape did make them sturdier, but at the cost of them being uncomfortable in an active situation.  They were also the largest earbuds, and stuck out from the side of my head further than I would have liked.My favorite?  The beats fit pro!  While I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this pair for everyone, it was perfect for my routine.  My music taste benefits from the boosted base, and the wingtip shape was perfect for any workouts.  The feature that really convinced me was the physical buttons, something that I didn‚Äôt realize how desperately I needed.Read more"

"Sennheiser Consumer Audio Momentum 4 Wireless Headphones - Bluetooth Headset for Crystal-Clear Calls with Adaptive Noise Cancellation, 60h Battery Life, Customizable Sound, White (509267)",$265.95,4.0 out of 5 stars,"7,609","5 stars to me. 4 stars all around for the average consumer due to issues I believe others will find a problem with but I have found some workarounds forI will start off with the flaws (unfortunately it has em) from my experience and some solutions. They are mostly features based. I'll also address confusions and ""negative"" experiences as there are reviews where clearly it's the people and not the headphones that are the problem yet they are giving this a worse impression that it should have. And lastly praise what it has going well for itAlso, I will highly suggest downloading the new app version called smart control PLUS and install any firmware updates. Then go adjust settings or it will have some annoyances.FlawsOn-head detection: this causes most of the headaches. For those that like to free up an ear to listen to someone talk better - make a habit of freeing your left ear and not the right. There is a sensor to detect your ear and it is only INSIDE the right earcup.  It makes a double click noise when it detects and stops detecting your ear. Unfortunately it makes a similar sound for both which is a huge flaw as you might not know if it is detecting or not sometimes. This will trigger the auto off feature if it doesn't detect you while you're listening to music. It usually pauses from the headset, but there is a possibility it can be ignored by an app and continue playing so when you put it back on you might not even know if it detected you. Another possibility is you made the mistake of pressing play from the app itself when it stops detecting you thus eventually triggering the sleep feature. You can disable auto off but I personally put it in 1 hour just in case as I would have likely readjusted my headset by that point and reset it. This goes into the next feature: auto play. It's perfectly fine on mobile but on PC it can be a nightmare as you could be listening to music, you adjust your right earcup so it pauses and when you put it back on, it might play some other video like youtube in an open browser; it depends on the programs that behave to bluetooth pause/play. So don't have so many open video/audio programs in the background. Also for those with long hair, autoplay can struggle to detect if it completely covers your right ear (some people start to think it stopped working). Overall, I just disabled autoplay while keeping auto-off enabled as I mainly use the M4 on PC, but again, it seems to work really well on mobile. Plus of course if any of these aren't necessary to you, you can simply disable it as a whole for an old fashioned headphone experience to avoid annoyances but I have gotten used to it at this point that I rarely have issues [Update: I just learned on May 2025 that as of the new firmware 2.13.42 it reads ""Improved auto-off behavior reducing unexpected behavior during calls or streaming due to misdetection in smart pause sensor"", so perhaps this section might become untrue with less flaws down the road thus hopefully improving user experience]Multi- point connection: It can and will connect to two devices that have bluetooth active after they have been paired. There are individuals that pair their headphones to everything and might experience a random connection. Unfortunately no disabling this so you have to be precise with what you want to connect this with. I only paired this to PC and mobile so it doesn't attempt to connect to anything else but in the app you can click to what else in the list want to connect to (or delete). When it detects multiple signals it will prioritize connecting to what you last used, it seems. Not an issue for me. Also, it will ALWAYS prioritize audio for the first connection of the two which will usually be the phone. This is important. If it connects to my phone first, well lets say Im on the PC listening to music, once your phone makes any kind of sound, your audio will switch to it and interrupt the music, then resume playing your PC's music. Because of this, disable useless sounds like the lock screen opening sounds because that will trigger a switch (not sure about typing sounds). I have sound on for notifications to get my attention for the phone but if that is an annoyance I would try connecting other devices (like PC) as your main device first and then phone second. That way, it will ONLY play audio on the main device (PC) in spite of your phone making noises or playing audio. I tend to disable phone bluetooth, so it isn't an issue for me what connects first anyways. Now, this is a major flaw which may have been addressed in the new firmware update and app but I have not fully tested yet so this is based on months old experience. Last flaw with this. Do not have constant audio playing on -BOTH- devices because it will cause some static to what you are listening to. No idea why this happens but sometimes the music sounds glitchy and I realize it's because my PC is playing music alongside my phone. All it takes is not having something like music playing on the second device and it gets clean.Reboot: it can be done on the power button after holding for over 15 seconds. Be careful NOT to do this if it is not your intention. I have a friend who accidentally did thisHigh resolution: app is glitched if you try to do personalized sound after enabling high resolution. It will ask you to disable high resolution before proceeding. All you have to do is go to standard mode, make your sound profile, then go back and enable High Resolution.Confusions:ANC: some people complain you can't turn off ANC. You sort of can. Old app, on the ANC slide, you put the slider in the middle. Most importantly, the new version of the app now allows to turn off ANC and might possibly increase your battery life. Oh, and some people remark of ANC randomly activating when outside. That is the wind noise reduction activating during air blowing directly to your mics. You can turn it off in ANC settings (you can also adjust transparency during phone calls there) but trust me that you don't want to hear wind transmitted into a headsetAuto-answer calls: complaints on this but another reason you need the app to disable it if you don't want it.Aut-connect: some complain that if it moves it will auto connect or cause confusion when they don't know why their bluetooth loud speakers stopped working until they realize the headphones are connected. I personally love auto connect and has never been an issue. I put my headphones away where it won't move at all and once I grab it, boom, just straightforward and smooth connection grab and go. This is a feature of auto off so if you don't want it to be doing this you can either disable auto off (more like sleep) or turn off the headphones directly from the power button (which means you will also have to turn it back on with the button). I don't think of it as a flaw to be honestDiscord/meeting calls: This is a big one. There are people mentioning how when they get on discord, their music and game sounds muffled. That is its hands free activating because it believes you are in a call. It prioritizes the call once it is activating its mic. You may have noticed it on your phone before too with music getting muffled. Problem is these then get compared directly to a gaming headset. Most gaming headsets have a usb dongle. Those dongles are designed to give both high quality low latency audio and mic signals at the same time. These? They are bluetooth headsets not specifically designed for gaming but rather for high quality audio. This is not a major fault of the headset. There exists a workaround for this but you will have to disable handsfree and rely on a different mic (which can be a far superior option anyways). To do this - on windows 11, go to settings. Click ""bluetooth & devices"". Then click on ""view more devices"" up top to go to a drop down list of devices. Scroll all the way down until you find ""more devices and printer settings"". Find the M4 headset, right click and go to properties. Click on the hardware tab. On this list, look for Name ""Momentum 4 Hands-Free"" that is under Type ""Sound, Video..."". Click once on it then click on properties below. In properties, General tab, click on the blue and yellow shield that says Change Settings. Then go to the Driver tab and Click Disable Driver. Reboot PC. Can be undone in similar method. At this point it has no headset mic active ~specifically~ on the PC (phone should be unaffected) so audio will be clear but now an external mic will be needed.Experiences:Connectivity: people say they have connectivity issues but thankfully it is very rare for me. It has a good distance to it too. I keep up to date with everything on my phoneTouchpad: some say it is very sensitive. It is certainly more sensitive than usual but there are exaggerations to it. My hair does not trigger it. Turning my head does not trigger it. I don't trigger it with a hoodie on. I don't wear beanies over it (why would you?) so I cant say anything there. Stretching my arms above my head might trigger and laying my head on the right side might make it think you want to change volume or transparency. But some of these reviews are funny. They are not rated to be water resistant at all (like most headsets) so if rain drops trigger it, actually no, WHY DO YOU EVEN HAVE IT IN THE RAIN?App: the app is fine minus the glitch [refer to High Resolution in Flaws] and has only been improving bit by bit. There's now also a new version which requires a new download that will likely be getting more of a focus onDurability: it is plastic which makes it lighter but thankfully I have not broken anything. I have bumped it into things, dropped it once. I try to treat is as glass so these are rare occurrences. I would not work out in these due to the fact they are not designed to deal with liquid. If problems occur because you work out in these, well that's your fault, but there exist rubber sweat covers to put over the padding to help out a bit. The Sennheisers Momentum 4/Sport earbuds I believe have water resistance and might be worth a look instead if you need a true gym companionStrengthsAudio quality: right out of the box, they are great. It has a neutral sound profile while having some attention to bass. There are presets in the app that are decent and it really does not need a bass booster but it exists. To be honest, I would skip everything and go straight for the sound personalization feature in the app. It's very simple to adjust, uses mostly sliders while you listen to audio. And once you are done it will create a setting that somehow manages to be far superior than what's already available in the app. It just cleans up the sound so much more to your liking; the difference is bewildering. Ever since that point, I have not listened to music the same. Just when I thought I was getting bored of music, these revived that love to want to listen to everything again and also motivated me to listen to things I never did before. There is literally pre-Sennheiser and during-Sennheiser eras to me now and am curious to their wired headsets. One thing that will become super noticeable is its soundstage. It spreads the instruments to a degree where you can notice more of everything. Albeit, this can be discombobulating and bassheads might not like the lack of sharp precision but this isn't meant to be your average linear listening experience (the Accentum Plus offers this at a much lower price). To give an example: What is Life by George Harrison. I might prefer it on the more linear style I am used to but these can separate things to the point where it is also directional and you can feel like you are standing at a concert and George is directly in the middle of it all in front of you so it feels more real- similar to as if you are becoming conscious of your own breathing. And in midst of all the chaos, you can still clearly hear George's voice and you notice ALL of the instruments more. It first gave me goosebumps how much it changed the song. Some songs are designed to be ""linear"" which could possibly affect emotional type of songs negatively but from a musical perspective, my goodness it is incredible. Now I just go back to see what music I am used to that changes with these (hint: a lot). Electronic/hip-hop music perhaps is the exception but this gives such clarity to detail that it is still a great listen- one thing is for sure these headsets love when there is a band setup (Bjork, the Roots, Gorillaz, etc). Sound quality is the biggest reason you go for these.Comfort: I can go on for a while without my ears hurting or anything. Also these don't heat up much and has proper adjustability for bigger headsLook: I have the black with copper ring and they are absolutely gorgeous. I question the longevity of the cloth on the headstrap but it makes it more beautiful than it has any business being for a plastic headsetFeatures: ANC is better than I expected. It does its job, and though it might not lead in this category, the differences are so small compared to the competition. Also drowned out what I needed it to during plane trips. And hearthrough, although I have had better, they will more than suffice to the point where I rarely have any issues hearing people. The fact that it is good at both of these is amazing for value.Battery: they can go up to nearly 60 hours, especially in standard mode. Not an exaggeration. I can go days without charging them. For this quality of headset, I don't think much of the competition comes close to this. In fact this is the mind blowing part because most other bluetooth headsets don't sound anywhere as good as these and they have half the battery life if not worse. No fears when travelling that it will die on me. In fact, it lasted me an entire week's tripSurprisesGaming: it has low enough latency. Combine that with that very clean audio and surprising directional audio this already has and wow, it performs quite well. I can actually spot details better and sometimes extra details I wasn't aware like I remember distinctly many months ago when I played Paladins, not only was I able to hear behind a wall slightly above me, but I realized it was subtle high heel sounds. I am not saying this will replace top of the line gaming headsets like steel series but if you have these and not a gaming headset, these will more than suffice.Charging: I was already enamored by the battery life but the fact is, it handles charging nearly as well. You can get hours worth per 10 minutes of charging and around an hour and a half or so it will be fully charged. That may not sound great but half of that will net you 30 hours of life which is STILL more than the competition. And the other surprise was that I accidentally discovered on the PC that you can still use it while charging - it simply appears as a different sound output you have to switch to. I thought it was weird how multiple momentum 4's appeared but when I clicked the other output, music started booming through it again. I was shocked. It already has a super long battery life with quick charging. It doesn't need it yet it has it. I have never had a headset that allows that with USB-C. Sennheiser were practically showing off at this point. So I would get a super long cable to make this comfortable during charging if you think this is a feature you will be usingThese are already the greatest -bluetooth- headsets I have ever owned under the $500 mark. I have tried out direct competitors Airpods Max (best hearthrough and good clean quality) and Sony Xm5's (amazing features and stylish) but the M4 felt like a no brainer. The max have poor battery life (under 20 hours) meanwhile these can reach close to triple that. The XM5's are light and so smooth with their features and touchpad (I loved speak to chat) but their fragility comes into question as they are notorious for the hinges breaking no matter how good you take care of them while the M4's mostly have earpads wearing down (easily replaceable). Meanwhile, guess what? The M4's imo sound better than both of them, are more comfortable than both, and can be found MUCH cheaper than both as I have seen it as low as $190. Even if, say, the Bowers & Wilkins PX8 might have slightly better audio and a better build, it's not a major difference so it is imo horrifically overpriced while this just has much higher value after sales and is an easier recommendationOverall, it absolutely bothers me just how overrated the other headsets on Amazon usually are meanwhile these get a bad impression. If you are a fan of music and you want to improve that experience with the bluetooth format at great affordability, it doesn't get better than theseRead more"

"Avantree Opera - Wireless Headphones for TV Watching with Clear Dialogue, Compatible with TVs Equipped with Optical or AUX Audio Output Ports, Passthrough, Enhanced Volume & Comfortable for Seniors",$119.99,4.3 out of 5 stars,"4,815","My father needed a simple solution for wireless headphones on his older Samsung Smart TV which did not have bluetooth support. We tried a standalone optical to bluetooth transmitter to work with another set of headphones he owned, but that setup was complicated and didn't always work.This product from Avantree was a perfect surprise; the headphones are comfortable and loud, and since they come with their own transmitter they ""just work."" I have heard no complaints about the battery life which means they work for at least a full day of steady TV watching, and they are also super easy to charge. The size is fully adjustable too.The base allows an additional optical audio out so that my dad can have these playing at the same time as his soundbar, so he can switch between the two without changing any settings.After about 10 months of great usage my father had an accident wherein the plastic hinges of the headset were physically snapped. Fortunately I had saved the original packaging because it contained an email address for Avantree support. I worked with Rie from their team who was extremely efficient, kind, and helpful, and they helped me get the headset replaced with a new pair under warranty.It was by far the single best customer service experience I have had in probably 15 years.Excellent product and excellent support from Avantree. I would highly recommend this product and buy from them again.Read more"

"Boean Bluetooth Headphones, Wireless Headphones with 16 Hours Playtime Bluetooth 5.3 Wireless Earbuds HD Deep Bass Stereo Sound Isolation IPX7 Waterproof Earphones for Workout Running Sports",$15.98,4.3 out of 5 stars,"10,340","I continue to love this brand and particular model.  The tech used by this product has been copied hundreds of times and you will find multiple variations available for sale.  I've bought several, and this one is the best.  The main differences are the way the bud stays secured in your ear, the type of USB connector to plug into the charging cord, and (oddly) whether the British woman's voice says ""YOUR HEADPHONES ARE CONNECTED"" or just ""CONNECTED"".  (They all say ""BATTERY LOW"" in the same manner, so that's just a strange difference.)What I like #1 is the connector.  This uses a USB-C connector, so (as the older type require) you don't have to try inserting it, realize it's upside down, turn it around, try again.What I like #2 is the way it secures.  Another design had a soft plastic mesh ""finger"" that would lock it into place on your ear, but that thing always seemed to slip out of place.  This model has the securing element built-in to the design of the earbud.  So with an easy twist forward, it's locked in.And #3, it's the full version of ""YOUR HEADPHONES ARE CONNECTED"".  Not that it's any big deal, but it seems almost like evidence that they didn't skimp, and paid the lady for 3 extra words.  (LOL, probably not)They do seem to make improvements with each updated model number.  There are a couple of tactile elements to the design that make it easier to identify where the button is (for pause/play, etc.).I don't actually use these sitting up or running, however.  My use is predominantly for bedtime white noise.  (I have a particular gentle-thunderstorm track that plays on repeat all night long.)  I'm a side sleeper, so any time I get up to shift sides, I swap one bud in, the other out, and just leave the other bud loose at the edge of the pillow.  It works well for this purpose.But I'm replacing a prior model where I must have squashed the free bud, and after about a year, something got sensitive and started shorting out the sound.  (no visible cord or bud damage, so it could have been ordinary device failure)  But for the price, it didn't upset me.  We'll see how this holds up over the year, but so far, it's all good.Sound quality is good, going plenty loud enough (for my purposes anyway).  I tend to dislike heavy bass (which causes permanent hearing loss anyway), and this doesn't really have that, so it's a good match for ME.  If you wanted that low-end inner-ear-damaging bass, this won't really deliver.  (I already pay the price for my youth with constant tinnitus -- kids, take care of your hearing!  The loud ringing 24/7 for the rest of your life seriously sucks. -- And no, the tinnitus is not because I listen to quiet rain sounds all night long, they are on low volume, and I had it long before starting to do this - the rain sounds are just to calm my thoughts.)Speaking of which, it has a good seal on your ear that really does help block noise.  (Sometimes I'm so tired that I forget to start the rain track, and it does a good job blocking those insects and highway noises.)Read more"

I can't feel the difference but I will but a new set of replacement cups for $10 - $15. Maybe they'd last longer if I wiped them down sometimes?They still work like the day I got them. I use them every day.2 Year Review Update!Still going strong! Still hold a great charge, no connection issues. I use them every night for several hours.No damage, all the buttons work, the padding is fine, no tears or wear. They look and operate like brand new. I love these things.If you can get them for around $100 or so do not hesitate.Updated Review #5 3/12/2022Still great! No issues whatsoever. Price is currently $129, I'd do it at that price. No disconnections. Noise cancellation makes my window fan almost silent while not noticeably affecting sound quality. Can't hear the roommates. I'm in my own world with these on.I use these for watching videos on a PC where I can EQ and raise the volume more than someone with a phone. I use them on my phone too, but my audio player has a way to boost the sound so that I can play them extra loud if I want to.Updated Review #4 11/10/2021Still working great after almost a year now, still comfortable. Still 5 stars. I use them every night for several hours. Still holds a long charge.Updated Review #3 5/27/2021Still working great, I love these things. Paid a little less than $100. Holds a charge great. Never drops the signal. Ever. I use them every night to watch movies and they're fantastic.I am no longer bothered by the ear cups no matter how I wear them. Maybe they softened up a little. These are bad ass!Updated Review #2 1/29/2021Okay I got these headphones to fit comfortably. I hope I can explain this. Back to 5-stars.I put the headphones on, then I swivel the cups forward, like putting more pressure near my temple (front of the ear), and less pressure on the back part of the ear (that sticks out from my head).The mistake is trying to fit them evenly over my ear, or flat against my head. At least for me. The cups are simply too small (they should be bigger!). Making this adjustment makes them fine for hours. I have no discomfort and the sound quality is not changed at all.I still think the narrow ear design is flawed (I believe I said ""stupid"" earlier), but the sound quality and price I paid keep these at 5 stars.And I repeat, for better and louder sound on a PC, I recommend the FREE ""Equalizer APO"". It EQ's all sounds coming from your computer to the headphones and speakers. Also download another free program called ""Peace"" to control the EQ easier. Way easier.Updated Review 1/19/2021These are uncomfortable after prolonged use. I can watch a movie, but after that it is sometimes a bit painful. The ear pads are poorly designed and I am looking to replace them. They are too narrow, I really don't understand why they were designed this way.Just looking at them tells you they are not made to fit over the ear of a human being. I just don't see how you can screw up that part of a headphone design. It's dumb.I paid $99 for these less than two months ago, now they are $146. If I'd paid $146 I would definitely return them, but for the price I paid I'm hoping I can find better ear pads instead. They sound great and I like everything else about them.I also may have found a way of positioning them so that they are more comfortable, but seriously why should I have to? I shouldn't even know I'm wearing them after a few minutes. What a stupid design.-------------------------This is my first pair of wireless headphones and I am very happy with them.They sound so much better than the cheap wired ones I usually get, and I used to think they were pretty good! I didn't know what I was missing before. Now I can re-watch some movies with incredible sound!I can see why some people will find the ear cup padding uncomfortable. I may end up replacing them, but if I adjust them over my ears right then I really don't have any problems. They could be a little wider though and I do have to move them a little sometimes. This is the only issue that could remove a star from my review, but like I said, so far I'm fine with it so all stars are intact.The sound is very clear and they do a good job covering the entire frequency range. I use Equalizer APO for my Windows machine, so whatever I run through the speakers or headphones is custom EQd. That makes a giant difference!The battery life kicks butt! They last so long I forget to recharge them. it's just not something I have to do very often :)For the first few weeks I could hit the center of the volume ""rocker"" button and it would tell me how much battery life I had left. I can't get that to work anymore. No biggie though. It will warn me if there is less than 12 hours left anyways when I turn them on.The noise cancellation works well. But really the full cup nature of these headphones deal with most noise without the need of electronics. If I wear these with no sound playing I can't hear much in the way of noise.I could do without the button that handles the track skipping and pausing. I sometimes hit it instead of the volume by mistake and my movie starts over from the beginning. I use a mouse for that stuff so I don't need it. I just take an extra moment to make sure I don't do that. Maybe I can put some tape over it. A lot of people like this feature so I'm probably in the minority.I paid about $99 for these and I am very happy. They could be louder on the phone though, but my music app has a volume boost that I can use. On the PC I can make them as loud as I want.I love not tripping over the wire of my old headphones anymore, or rolling over the wire with my chair. Such an annoyance! Wireless is awesome!The sound quality is very good. Wireless headphones downsample the audio before streaming to your ears, but with these I can't tell. They are also HD in that regard - they transmit a higher quality sound. And if you're really picky you can plug them in with the cord and get full sound. I can't tell the difference.I had to buy a Bluetooth adapter so I got one here at Amazon. get Bluetooth 5! I had an issue getting all this to work, but once I figured it out they work great.I did a ton of research before buying these. I look forward to watching movies and listening to music more now. I highly recommend them, they are awesome!Read more"

"HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless - Gaming Headset for PC, 300-hour battery life, DTS Headphone:X Spatial Audio, Memory foam, Dual Chamber Drivers, Noise-canceling mic, Durable aluminum frame,Red",$141.99,4.3 out of 5 stars,"5,166","(TL;DR at bottom)-----------------------------------background--------------------------------------***I've used this headset for 4 months now at the time of this initial post***For comparison:-I've tried many headsets from razer and turtle beach-Last headset was: Razer BlackShark V2 ProWhat I wanted in a headset:-Good sound quality-Durable-Wireless-Comfort for long duration-Extensive battery per charge (main focus)-Isn't overly pricedI work as a developer and use it to listen to music for the greater part of my day then bring them home for entertainment usage like gaming. It was an absolute pain if I just so happened to forget to charge the night before or forget the charging cord between places.-----------------------------------sound quality---------------------------------------In all honesty, the sound quality felt pretty typical for a gaming headset and is what you'd expect it to be.-This does NOT mean it is bad in any way. It is pretty good, but it's standard and nothing too crazy; certainly isn't music production level quality.-In comparison to the razer, it does feel slightly sharper/more pronounced but the difference is negligible. The only time I can notice the difference is probably swapping headsets between an extended time of use.-----------------------------------durability-------------------------------------------It is very durable in comparison to headsets I've used in the past and this exceeded my expectations greatly.-On numerous occasions as I'm holding it or taking it somewhere, I'd clumsily drop it on pavement as I'm walking or accidentally scrape it a bit against a surface. Still no marks to this day.-It is also very flexible so extensively bending it outwards when putting it on does it no harm.-The last turtle beach headset I ever used did not last even a year under even tamer conditions as I wasn't using it as much as I do now. It was hard plastic and the left ear piece literally snapped and was just a wire keeping it dangling.-The prior razer headset was far better than any of the turtle beaches, but on the occasions where I clumsily dropped it against a pavement or a rigid surface, it will leave a mark quite easily.-----------------------------------comfortability-------------------------------------------As I said, it is quite flexible and the ear pieces are cushioned well with foam.-This effectively means it wont feel like a freakin' clamp on your head when wearing it for a long duration where the headset is constantly trying to curl back into place.-The cushion on the ear pieces and above the head passes standard comfortability and is nothing mind-blowing.-The last turtle beach headset was a clamp. It's plastic material wasn't flexible (which contributed to why it snapped) and was always uncomfortable after wearing for only a few consecutive hours.-The razer was more comfortable but the compromises that build design brought far outweighed what this hyperx has to offer. By compromises, I'm primarily referring to noise cancellation as sound would just go come through the foam quite easily for the raze; the hyperx greatly avoids this issue. Regardless, the hyperx is still comfortable enough to where I can enjoy it for just as long.-----------------------------------wireless---------------------------------------------------It's wireless functionality works over a further distance away than any of the prior headsets I've used. I can go from room to room on the same floor or a floor down/up and it'd still work perfectly fine. Anything further than that will progressively lose connection and cutout more and more which is understandable.-In terms of close connection, I've NEVER lost connection at my desk as long as it had battery.-All of my older headsets that are wireless could barely go from room to room. The most prior modern headset I had, the razer, would entirely lose connection a floor above or below and experience constant cutouts going out of my room to just across the hall. Either hyperx is just ahead of the game or these others are settling on a budget.-----------------------------------300 hr battery life---------------------------------------------------This perk alone probably made the purchase for me.-I have NOT tested this to the full duration extent because I normally just charge it when it hits around 10-20%, but the longevity is no gimmick.-From experience, at the very least, it has lasted over 3 weeks over average daily use of around 10-12 hrs.-Needless to say, even if it isn't hitting the full 300hrs and is certainly a hell of a lot better than needing to remember to charge a headset every single night. It brought me great convenience and far surpassed my expectations.-----------------------------------other quirks and benefits---------------------------------------------------The material of the earpiece/foam is contained by an outer layering and this layering covers the ears very well for decent noise cancellation.-Also because it has this outer layering, cleaning/wiping it is a painless process.-The mic when you mute via headset (there a button under the left ear) will turn on a red led on the mic piece to indicate and let you know you're muted.-The volume adjuster is a scroll wheel under the right ear which makes the design more sleek without having a random knob sticking out of the side.-When you hold the power button to turn on the headset, it will tell you your battery percentage-When your headset is already turned on, you can just click the power button once and it will also tell you the battery percentage.-When no audio is played even if you're at your desk and online, it will turn off by itself to conserve battery.-When you go way too far from connection, it will think you're offline and do the same to conserve battery.Aside from the noise cancellation and automatic turn off for some of my older headsets, the other benefits I just listed weren't available which just adds to the worth for buying this headset for me.-----------------------------------cons-----------------------------------------------------Only three cons to date that didn't really matter much to me, but should be made aware.1) ***VERY RARELY*** when I go too far away from connection, the headset will glitch blaring the same sound loudly. It's tough to explain the issue but you can just turn off and then turn the headset back on to fix it.-Nothing like this ever happened to me while at my desk though.-And out of the numerous times I walk a bit far from connection it normally will turn off by itself to conserve battery thinking you're offline, but only around 2-3 times so far that I can remember has this issue occurred.2) This 2nd issue may be more of a deal breaker to some, and I don't know if it's a common issue. The audio scroll on my headset doesn't really work sometimes (it is inconsistent). I personally didn't really care because I set audio levels through my settings, pc, and individual website instead of adjusting them all through the scroll.3) Although it does read the battery percentage to you, it does so only in 10s (i.e. ""Battery level is 40%"" or ""Battery level is 50%""); no in between.-----------------------------------pricing---------------------------------------------------I bought this when it was at $119.99 around black friday - cyber monday time, so it was even more worth it in my opinion. I don't remember the original pricing before the sale, so can't really compare that price to where it's gone right now.-The rounded price of the razer right now is $130 and this hyperx is $170. The greater convenience and benefits this hyperx provides in comparison far outweighs the difference of $40 for me. Unless there some other brand doing what hyperx is doing with same-better quality and pricing that I've not kept up with, I can't recommend this one enough.-----------------------------------TL:DR---------------------------------------------------SOUND QUALITY is as expected and is of standard for a gaming type headset. (nothing mind-blowing)-DURABILITY is very good in comparison. Numerous drops or light scrapes often don't even leave a mark from my experience using it.-COMFORTABILITY: above standard but not the best I've had. The headset's frame is quite flexible while remaining durable so it won't feel like a clamp wearing it for long periods of time as some headsets I've had always try to squeeze back to place given their less flexible material.-WIRELESS over way longer distances compared to past purchases. Room to room, floor above, or floor below all remain stable in connection. Anything further gradually loses connection.-300HR BATTERY LIFE: While untested to the full extent, from experience. I can confirm I've gone uncharged for over 3 weeks of daily 10-12hr usage. Far more convenient than any other headset I've used.OTHER QUIRKS/BENEFITS:1) Foam for earpieces and above head have outer layer, making it easier to clean and provides decent noise cancellation.2) Mic piece lights up red when you click the mute button on headset as a convenient indication.3) Volume adjuster (scroll) under right ear piece instead of a knob makes headset more sleek.4) Turning on headset or clicking power button while on will read you a rough estimate of the battery percentage left.5) When too far from connection or no audio is played for a period of time(even if you're within connection), it turns off automatically to reserve battery.CONS:1) When too far away, normally it turns off by itself, but in the 4 months I've used it, around only 2-3 times it glitches and blares a non-ending long sound.2) Although it reads you the battery percent, it only does so by 10s and no in between.3) The audio scroll on the headset is inconsistent (sometimes it doesn't work); doesn't really affect you if you adjust volume through pc settings.-PRICING: out of all the headsets I've used so far, this has to be the best I've had thus far. Even if I splurge a bit more than other headsets on the market right now, the battery life and comfort alone wins me over.---------------------------------------------------------------***WOULD I BUY THIS AGAIN / RECOMMEND IT?***-Absolutely, yes. I can't recommend this enough.---------------------------------------------------------------Hope this review helped, and happy shopping! :)Read more"
"DOQAUS Over Ear Bluetooth Headphones Wireless, 90H Playtime, BT 5.4, 9 EQ Modes, HiFi Deep Bass, Movie & Sleep Mode, White Noises w/App Control, Memory Foam Cups for Travel, Gym, Workout, PC, Phone",$16.97,4.4 out of 5 stars,"7,424","Build Quality: It's good. Comfortable to wear, and it lasts quite a long time. I bought these about 1 1/2 years ago, and with standard care to them they lasted me until now. They're still plenty usable and fully functional. But from all the time that I've used them, the foam/cushion around the ear has started to break down, and I've opted to upgrade to more expensive headphones. However, you can probably replace the ear muffs, and even if they don't, these headphones will last quite a long amount of time.Audio: I've used quite a lot of headphones at this price point, so the clarity and depth of the bass definitely shocked me the first time I used them. The Bluetooth was as good, and I can't tell you how good it is wired since I didn't use them wired very much.Comfort: The headphones were pretty comfortable. Some people might find extended use with them slightly uncomfortable, but for me, they were comfortable enough to use for hours. The battery life is good for this price point. One charge will last you days (how many depends on your usage).Size: They fit most head sizes, since you can extend or retract those headphone-extension (which i find quite durable) things on either side of them. They're also foldable -- which makes it easy to store in a bag whenever I travel.Overall, 100% worth it, for having bought them in the $20-30 range. Especially, the blue color is an added bonus that makes them feel more premium.Read more"

"Sennheiser Consumer Audio Momentum 4 Wireless Headphones - Bluetooth Headset for Crystal-Clear Calls with Adaptive Noise Cancellation, 60h Battery Life, Customizable Sound, White (509267)",$265.95,4.0 out of 5 stars,"7,609","5 stars to me. 4 stars all around for the average consumer due to issues I believe others will find a problem with but I have found some workarounds forI will start off with the flaws (unfortunately it has em) from my experience and some solutions. They are mostly features based. I'll also address confusions and ""negative"" experiences as there are reviews where clearly it's the people and not the headphones that are the problem yet they are giving this a worse impression that it should have. And lastly praise what it has going well for itAlso, I will highly suggest downloading the new app version called smart control PLUS and install any firmware updates. Then go adjust settings or it will have some annoyances.FlawsOn-head detection: this causes most of the headaches. For those that like to free up an ear to listen to someone talk better - make a habit of freeing your left ear and not the right. There is a sensor to detect your ear and it is only INSIDE the right earcup.  It makes a double click noise when it detects and stops detecting your ear. Unfortunately it makes a similar sound for both which is a huge flaw as you might not know if it is detecting or not sometimes. This will trigger the auto off feature if it doesn't detect you while you're listening to music. It usually pauses from the headset, but there is a possibility it can be ignored by an app and continue playing so when you put it back on you might not even know if it detected you. Another possibility is you made the mistake of pressing play from the app itself when it stops detecting you thus eventually triggering the sleep feature. You can disable auto off but I personally put it in 1 hour just in case as I would have likely readjusted my headset by that point and reset it. This goes into the next feature: auto play. It's perfectly fine on mobile but on PC it can be a nightmare as you could be listening to music, you adjust your right earcup so it pauses and when you put it back on, it might play some other video like youtube in an open browser; it depends on the programs that behave to bluetooth pause/play. So don't have so many open video/audio programs in the background. Also for those with long hair, autoplay can struggle to detect if it completely covers your right ear (some people start to think it stopped working). Overall, I just disabled autoplay while keeping auto-off enabled as I mainly use the M4 on PC, but again, it seems to work really well on mobile. Plus of course if any of these aren't necessary to you, you can simply disable it as a whole for an old fashioned headphone experience to avoid annoyances but I have gotten used to it at this point that I rarely have issues [Update: I just learned on May 2025 that as of the new firmware 2.13.42 it reads ""Improved auto-off behavior reducing unexpected behavior during calls or streaming due to misdetection in smart pause sensor"", so perhaps this section might become untrue with less flaws down the road thus hopefully improving user experience]Multi- point connection: It can and will connect to two devices that have bluetooth active after they have been paired. There are individuals that pair their headphones to everything and might experience a random connection. Unfortunately no disabling this so you have to be precise with what you want to connect this with. I only paired this to PC and mobile so it doesn't attempt to connect to anything else but in the app you can click to what else in the list want to connect to (or delete). When it detects multiple signals it will prioritize connecting to what you last used, it seems. Not an issue for me. Also, it will ALWAYS prioritize audio for the first connection of the two which will usually be the phone. This is important. If it connects to my phone first, well lets say Im on the PC listening to music, once your phone makes any kind of sound, your audio will switch to it and interrupt the music, then resume playing your PC's music. Because of this, disable useless sounds like the lock screen opening sounds because that will trigger a switch (not sure about typing sounds). I have sound on for notifications to get my attention for the phone but if that is an annoyance I would try connecting other devices (like PC) as your main device first and then phone second. That way, it will ONLY play audio on the main device (PC) in spite of your phone making noises or playing audio. I tend to disable phone bluetooth, so it isn't an issue for me what connects first anyways. Now, this is a major flaw which may have been addressed in the new firmware update and app but I have not fully tested yet so this is based on months old experience. Last flaw with this. Do not have constant audio playing on -BOTH- devices because it will cause some static to what you are listening to. No idea why this happens but sometimes the music sounds glitchy and I realize it's because my PC is playing music alongside my phone. All it takes is not having something like music playing on the second device and it gets clean.Reboot: it can be done on the power button after holding for over 15 seconds. Be careful NOT to do this if it is not your intention. I have a friend who accidentally did thisHigh resolution: app is glitched if you try to do personalized sound after enabling high resolution. It will ask you to disable high resolution before proceeding. All you have to do is go to standard mode, make your sound profile, then go back and enable High Resolution.Confusions:ANC: some people complain you can't turn off ANC. You sort of can. Old app, on the ANC slide, you put the slider in the middle. Most importantly, the new version of the app now allows to turn off ANC and might possibly increase your battery life. Oh, and some people remark of ANC randomly activating when outside. That is the wind noise reduction activating during air blowing directly to your mics. You can turn it off in ANC settings (you can also adjust transparency during phone calls there) but trust me that you don't want to hear wind transmitted into a headsetAuto-answer calls: complaints on this but another reason you need the app to disable it if you don't want it.Aut-connect: some complain that if it moves it will auto connect or cause confusion when they don't know why their bluetooth loud speakers stopped working until they realize the headphones are connected. I personally love auto connect and has never been an issue. I put my headphones away where it won't move at all and once I grab it, boom, just straightforward and smooth connection grab and go. This is a feature of auto off so if you don't want it to be doing this you can either disable auto off (more like sleep) or turn off the headphones directly from the power button (which means you will also have to turn it back on with the button). I don't think of it as a flaw to be honestDiscord/meeting calls: This is a big one. There are people mentioning how when they get on discord, their music and game sounds muffled. That is its hands free activating because it believes you are in a call. It prioritizes the call once it is activating its mic. You may have noticed it on your phone before too with music getting muffled. Problem is these then get compared directly to a gaming headset. Most gaming headsets have a usb dongle. Those dongles are designed to give both high quality low latency audio and mic signals at the same time. These? They are bluetooth headsets not specifically designed for gaming but rather for high quality audio. This is not a major fault of the headset. There exists a workaround for this but you will have to disable handsfree and rely on a different mic (which can be a far superior option anyways). To do this - on windows 11, go to settings. Click ""bluetooth & devices"". Then click on ""view more devices"" up top to go to a drop down list of devices. Scroll all the way down until you find ""more devices and printer settings"". Find the M4 headset, right click and go to properties. Click on the hardware tab. On this list, look for Name ""Momentum 4 Hands-Free"" that is under Type ""Sound, Video..."". Click once on it then click on properties below. In properties, General tab, click on the blue and yellow shield that says Change Settings. Then go to the Driver tab and Click Disable Driver. Reboot PC. Can be undone in similar method. At this point it has no headset mic active ~specifically~ on the PC (phone should be unaffected) so audio will be clear but now an external mic will be needed.Experiences:Connectivity: people say they have connectivity issues but thankfully it is very rare for me. It has a good distance to it too. I keep up to date with everything on my phoneTouchpad: some say it is very sensitive. It is certainly more sensitive than usual but there are exaggerations to it. My hair does not trigger it. Turning my head does not trigger it. I don't trigger it with a hoodie on. I don't wear beanies over it (why would you?) so I cant say anything there. Stretching my arms above my head might trigger and laying my head on the right side might make it think you want to change volume or transparency. But some of these reviews are funny. They are not rated to be water resistant at all (like most headsets) so if rain drops trigger it, actually no, WHY DO YOU EVEN HAVE IT IN THE RAIN?App: the app is fine minus the glitch [refer to High Resolution in Flaws] and has only been improving bit by bit. There's now also a new version which requires a new download that will likely be getting more of a focus onDurability: it is plastic which makes it lighter but thankfully I have not broken anything. I have bumped it into things, dropped it once. I try to treat is as glass so these are rare occurrences. I would not work out in these due to the fact they are not designed to deal with liquid. If problems occur because you work out in these, well that's your fault, but there exist rubber sweat covers to put over the padding to help out a bit. The Sennheisers Momentum 4/Sport earbuds I believe have water resistance and might be worth a look instead if you need a true gym companionStrengthsAudio quality: right out of the box, they are great. It has a neutral sound profile while having some attention to bass. There are presets in the app that are decent and it really does not need a bass booster but it exists. To be honest, I would skip everything and go straight for the sound personalization feature in the app. It's very simple to adjust, uses mostly sliders while you listen to audio. And once you are done it will create a setting that somehow manages to be far superior than what's already available in the app. It just cleans up the sound so much more to your liking; the difference is bewildering. Ever since that point, I have not listened to music the same. Just when I thought I was getting bored of music, these revived that love to want to listen to everything again and also motivated me to listen to things I never did before. There is literally pre-Sennheiser and during-Sennheiser eras to me now and am curious to their wired headsets. One thing that will become super noticeable is its soundstage. It spreads the instruments to a degree where you can notice more of everything. Albeit, this can be discombobulating and bassheads might not like the lack of sharp precision but this isn't meant to be your average linear listening experience (the Accentum Plus offers this at a much lower price). To give an example: What is Life by George Harrison. I might prefer it on the more linear style I am used to but these can separate things to the point where it is also directional and you can feel like you are standing at a concert and George is directly in the middle of it all in front of you so it feels more real- similar to as if you are becoming conscious of your own breathing. And in midst of all the chaos, you can still clearly hear George's voice and you notice ALL of the instruments more. It first gave me goosebumps how much it changed the song. Some songs are designed to be ""linear"" which could possibly affect emotional type of songs negatively but from a musical perspective, my goodness it is incredible. Now I just go back to see what music I am used to that changes with these (hint: a lot). Electronic/hip-hop music perhaps is the exception but this gives such clarity to detail that it is still a great listen- one thing is for sure these headsets love when there is a band setup (Bjork, the Roots, Gorillaz, etc). Sound quality is the biggest reason you go for these.Comfort: I can go on for a while without my ears hurting or anything. Also these don't heat up much and has proper adjustability for bigger headsLook: I have the black with copper ring and they are absolutely gorgeous. I question the longevity of the cloth on the headstrap but it makes it more beautiful than it has any business being for a plastic headsetFeatures: ANC is better than I expected. It does its job, and though it might not lead in this category, the differences are so small compared to the competition. Also drowned out what I needed it to during plane trips. And hearthrough, although I have had better, they will more than suffice to the point where I rarely have any issues hearing people. The fact that it is good at both of these is amazing for value.Battery: they can go up to nearly 60 hours, especially in standard mode. Not an exaggeration. I can go days without charging them. For this quality of headset, I don't think much of the competition comes close to this. In fact this is the mind blowing part because most other bluetooth headsets don't sound anywhere as good as these and they have half the battery life if not worse. No fears when travelling that it will die on me. In fact, it lasted me an entire week's tripSurprisesGaming: it has low enough latency. Combine that with that very clean audio and surprising directional audio this already has and wow, it performs quite well. I can actually spot details better and sometimes extra details I wasn't aware like I remember distinctly many months ago when I played Paladins, not only was I able to hear behind a wall slightly above me, but I realized it was subtle high heel sounds. I am not saying this will replace top of the line gaming headsets like steel series but if you have these and not a gaming headset, these will more than suffice.Charging: I was already enamored by the battery life but the fact is, it handles charging nearly as well. You can get hours worth per 10 minutes of charging and around an hour and a half or so it will be fully charged. That may not sound great but half of that will net you 30 hours of life which is STILL more than the competition. And the other surprise was that I accidentally discovered on the PC that you can still use it while charging - it simply appears as a different sound output you have to switch to. I thought it was weird how multiple momentum 4's appeared but when I clicked the other output, music started booming through it again. I was shocked. It already has a super long battery life with quick charging. It doesn't need it yet it has it. I have never had a headset that allows that with USB-C. Sennheiser were practically showing off at this point. So I would get a super long cable to make this comfortable during charging if you think this is a feature you will be usingThese are already the greatest -bluetooth- headsets I have ever owned under the $500 mark. I have tried out direct competitors Airpods Max (best hearthrough and good clean quality) and Sony Xm5's (amazing features and stylish) but the M4 felt like a no brainer. The max have poor battery life (under 20 hours) meanwhile these can reach close to triple that. The XM5's are light and so smooth with their features and touchpad (I loved speak to chat) but their fragility comes into question as they are notorious for the hinges breaking no matter how good you take care of them while the M4's mostly have earpads wearing down (easily replaceable). Meanwhile, guess what? The M4's imo sound better than both of them, are more comfortable than both, and can be found MUCH cheaper than both as I have seen it as low as $190. Even if, say, the Bowers & Wilkins PX8 might have slightly better audio and a better build, it's not a major difference so it is imo horrifically overpriced while this just has much higher value after sales and is an easier recommendationOverall, it absolutely bothers me just how overrated the other headsets on Amazon usually are meanwhile these get a bad impression. If you are a fan of music and you want to improve that experience with the bluetooth format at great affordability, it doesn't get better than theseRead more"
"Monster Mission 200 Bluetooth Headphones, Wireless Headphones with 3 EQ Modes, Low Latency HiFi Stereo Foldable Lightweight Headset, 60H Playtime,Deep Bass for Home Office Cellphone PC Ect",$35.99,4.2 out of 5 stars,41,"Was not optimistic with these, both because the box was bashed and because the headphones feel really lightweight and could be perceived as cheap feeling. Nonetheless the sound quality is amazing with tooooons of bass. These are advertised as over the ear but are kind of over, kind of on. I can't stand the sound and feeling of on ear headphones but these feel really good actually. The EQ settings are pretty useless. One is clear with great bass, the other has a lot of mid, and the other is just flat. Skip em and keep it on ""voice"" setting. Comes with a 3.5mm cable and USB-C charging cable. The color is ok, kind of yellow, kind of pinkish. A little bulky out of the corner of my eye. The fold up really nicely. Not sure if it's worth $160+ but a good starting point if you like a lot of bass. But for the price I would like some actual ANC. Have paid 1/4 the price and got ANC, just not as good of bass.Read more"

"TOZO T12 Wireless Earbuds Bluetooth 5.3 Headphones, Call ENC Noise Cancelling Mic, 55Hrs Playtime App Customize EQ IPX8 Waterproof LED Digital Display Premium Sound Headset",$19.98,4.3 out of 5 stars,"76,562","If you're hunting a budget set of Bluetooth earbuds, the TOZO T12s are absolutely the best deal on the market! I'm not quite a true ""audiophile"", but I'm a music producer and own many a set of headphones and earbuds and plenty of speakers from the big names in high-quality audio including Klipsch, JBL, Audio Technica, Bose, Ultrasone, and others I'm probably forgetting. I'm not going to tell you these are some kind of magic bullet that outperforms any of those in terms of audio quality, but for the price? Wow, do they get a lot closer than you'd expect. The highs aren't tinny, the mids are present and clear, and the bass response is surprisingly solid, but not boomy either. Nothing groundbreaking, but for listening to Spotify at work? These will do everything you need and then some. I bought these expecting them to be a sort of in-betweener pair just so I could survive while I hunted for a fancier set, but I've quickly found that they check every box on my list and then some.As far as durability goes, I'm very impressed. I've held off on reviewing these because I wanted to see how they held up to the abuse I typically subject earbuds to, and so far they're doing exceptionally well. I primarily use these at work in an outdoor environment, and as a result, these earbuds see more abuse than most - I've dropped them onto concrete, stuck them in a back pocket to get smushed getting in and out of cars, been caught in the rain and left them out of their case overnight and even a few weekends over the few months I've had them and they just don't care, they still look brand-new and work perfectly, while others I've owned haven't managed to last even this long in the same environment. The case, by comparison, feels a little less durable, and so far has some scuffs and scratches from living most of its life in a work-vest pocket filled with various other tools. The top of the clamshell case has always felt slightly flimsy but has held up fine so far under hard use.I find that the charging logic of these headphones is also pretty intelligent. Coming off a set of much pricier JBL Bluetooth earbuds, these hold a charge far longer than they did even when brand new. I regularly listen for 4 hour stretches and only charge them during breaks and after my shift, and have yet to actually drain these earbuds whereas my JBLs would regularly die mid-shift. It seems as though the earbuds themselves have better internal batteries than what's in the case - I'm only able to get about two to three charges out of the case before it's dangerously low, but that's preferable to me than the opposite, where the case lasts forever but the earbuds are constantly needing recharged like the JBLs.  I believe this has resulted a slightly heavier pair of earbuds than the norm, which may cause some people issues with fatigue or them falling out of your ears easier than others, but I find their weight to be a non-issue. I also like that the charging pins in the case are prominent, spring loaded, and easy to clean, which was another major failure point on the JBLs, and most of why I gave up trying to limp them along.Another factor that's easily overlooked with Bluetooth earbuds is simplicity. I just want them to work. I don't want to fiddle with an app, or set up any extra voice control features, or deal with firmware updates. I want them to pair automatically and start playing when I hit the button with no add-on garbage standing between me and my music. These do exactly that, zero extra complication. Of course, that means that there's no extra features like active noise canceling or EQs to adjust either, but I see it as a worthwhile price to pay for simplicity - you can EQ to your heart's desire in most audio players and I find that so far as noise canceling goes, the included tips are adequate for even (very) loud environments. Checking the battery level is easy enough on my phone while the earbuds are in use, and the LCD readout in the case works great to check its battery level as well rather than relying on inconsistent notifications to tell you the case battery level like my old JBLs.I generally don't use these earbuds for calls, but I have been called with these earbuds still paired a few times and the experience has been perfectly acceptable. The default setting in my phone with these earbuds paired uses the phone's mic versus the earbuds', but that works well given that the quality of these earbuds' mic isn't exactly top-notch. It is certainly functional, but don't plan on using these to record studio-ready vocals (not that you or I did in the first place.) I find this to be the area of these earbuds that perform most in-line with a $30 set of Bluetooth earbuds (i.e cheap.) Given that it's all going to get bounced off a few dozen cell towers and end up sounding like a tin-can-and-wire outfit regardless, nobody's going to lose any sleep over the T12s' built-in mic.If after all that and you're still on the fence, I say just go for it with these TOZO T12s. The value of these earbuds versus those costing literally double the price can't be understated - these will do the job and leave you impressed. Should I somehow manage to kill this set, I fully plan to buy another and I'll still feel like I got my money's worth.Read more"

For the price, these are excellent and outperformed a pair of beats studio pro that I am returning.Full disclosure: I am using a Samsung zfold 2. It's an older phone with different outputs that do affect sound quality. I am switching from using an original set of galaxy buds. This is to say, it's been a minute since I've upgraded and I'm comparing any new headphones to the galaxy bud quality.These headphones are amazing. Do they perform at the same level as a comparable pair of upper level priced headphones (ie bose)? No. Do they hit above some their mid level priced competitors? Absolutely. These have a fullness to the music and the base just hits right.I bought a pair of Beats Studio Pro ($180) that were disappointing in comparison. I had to have the volume all the way up and I still wasn't able to really hear the deep base. The sound was flat (all three modes tested). Switching from wireless to wired was alarmingly bad as they were even quieter. I don't have that issue with these.As soon as I hit play with these on, the difference between the two headsets was insane to me. I like to close my eyes so I can completely focus on the music and really feel it. I'm someone who likes to see what my brain creates on how someone would perform the song and what feelings they are trying to envoke while you listen. These are amazing and let me get truly lost in the music.So while they don't out perform a pair of $350+ headphones but they smashed those $180 beats out of the park.Build seems good. Doesn't feel to flimsy and I do love the color. I will probably look at getting a more structured carrying case instead of the provided black bag. I literally just have them delivered, so I haven't gotten to test battery life.Read more"
Open Ear Earbuds Lightweight Comfort Clip Wireless Earbuds Sweat Resistant Bluetooth Headphones Sport Headphones for Workouts and Running with Dual Digital Display 44H Playtime IPX7 Waterproof,$9.99,4.4 out of 5 stars,850,"These ear-clip phones are incredible.  Fantastic comfort, surprisingly great audio quality (even on bass reproduction!), and super easy user experience from the initial pairing to intuitive touch button-tap system.  Took a little bit of time, maybe 10 minutes out of the box, to figure out the volume adjustments, and how to determine what the charging indicators were displaying. I hesitate to say this, maybe from brand self-shaming, but my Bose Open Earphones (similar technology for audio where the drivers are outside the ear canal) are neck and neck with these.  But those cost $300 new.I've now bought 3 pairs of these so my wife can have some between her work laptop and here at home surfing Netflix on the iPad.  She loves the unobtrusive design and comfort away from her glasses, unlike just about every other ""over the ear"" form factor out there.  She was also hilariously awestruck when first listening to music; she couldn't believe that my son and I couldn't hear what she was playing.  Also, the reproduction quality of the tune she played was so good, that she felt like the reverb on the recording was coming from inside the house!If you get anything from this review, just know I'm a sound designer by trade, so my hearing is literally the most important thing for me to protect - and open earphones are the best way to do so, outside of maybe bone conduction.

For those that like to free up an ear to listen to someone talk better - make a habit of freeing your left ear and not the right. There is a sensor to detect your ear and it is only INSIDE the right earcup.  It makes a double click noise when it detects and stops detecting your ear. Unfortunately it makes a similar sound for both which is a huge flaw as you might not know if it is detecting or not sometimes. This will trigger the auto off feature if it doesn't detect you while you're listening to music. It usually pauses from the headset, but there is a possibility it can be ignored by an app and continue playing so when you put it back on you might not even know if it detected you. Another possibility is you made the mistake of pressing play from the app itself when it stops detecting you thus eventually triggering the sleep feature. You can disable auto off but I personally put it in 1 hour just in case as I would have likely readjusted my headset by that point and reset it. This goes into the next feature: auto play. It's perfectly fine on mobile but on PC it can be a nightmare as you could be listening to music, you adjust your right earcup so it pauses and when you put it back on, it might play some other video like youtube in an open browser; it depends on the programs that behave to bluetooth pause/play. So don't have so many open video/audio programs in the background. Also for those with long hair, autoplay can struggle to detect if it completely covers your right ear (some people start to think it stopped working). Overall, I just disabled autoplay while keeping auto-off enabled as I mainly use the M4 on PC, but again, it seems to work really well on mobile. Plus of course if any of these aren't necessary to you, you can simply disable it as a whole for an old fashioned headphone experience to avoid annoyances but I have gotten used to it at this point that I rarely have issues [Update: I just learned on May 2025 that as of the new firmware 2.13.42 it reads ""Improved auto-off behavior reducing unexpected behavior during calls or streaming due to misdetection in smart pause sensor"", so perhaps this section might become untrue with less flaws down the road thus hopefully improving user experience]Multi- point connection: It can and will connect to two devices that have bluetooth active after they have been paired. There are individuals that pair their headphones to everything and might experience a random connection. Unfortunately no disabling this so you have to be precise with what you want to connect this with. I only paired this to PC and mobile so it doesn't attempt to connect to anything else but in the app you can click to what else in the list want to connect to (or delete). When it detects multiple signals it will prioritize connecting to what you last used, it seems. Not an issue for me. Also, it will ALWAYS prioritize audio for the first connection of the two which will usually be the phone. This is important. If it connects to my phone first, well lets say Im on the PC listening to music, once your phone makes any kind of sound, your audio will switch to it and interrupt the music, then resume playing your PC's music. Because of this, disable useless sounds like the lock screen opening sounds because that will trigger a switch (not sure about typing sounds). I have sound on for notifications to get my attention for the phone but if that is an annoyance I would try connecting other devices (like PC) as your main device first and then phone second. That way, it will ONLY play audio on the main device (PC) in spite of your phone making noises or playing audio. I tend to disable phone bluetooth, so it isn't an issue for me what connects first anyways. Now, this is a major flaw which may have been addressed in the new firmware update and app but I have not fully tested yet so this is based on months old experience. Last flaw with this. Do not have constant audio playing on -BOTH- devices because it will cause some static to what you are listening to. No idea why this happens but sometimes the music sounds glitchy and I realize it's because my PC is playing music alongside my phone. All it takes is not having something like music playing on the second device and it gets clean.Reboot: it can be done on the power button after holding for over 15 seconds. Be careful NOT to do this if it is not your intention. I have a friend who accidentally did thisHigh resolution: app is glitched if you try to do personalized sound after enabling high resolution. It will ask you to disable high resolution before proceeding. All you have to do is go to standard mode, make your sound profile, then go back and enable High Resolution.Confusions:ANC: some people complain you can't turn off ANC. You sort of can. Old app, on the ANC slide, you put the slider in the middle. Most importantly, the new version of the app now allows to turn off ANC and might possibly increase your battery life. Oh, and some people remark of ANC randomly activating when outside. That is the wind noise reduction activating during air blowing directly to your mics. You can turn it off in ANC settings (you can also adjust transparency during phone calls there) but trust me that you don't want to hear wind transmitted into a headsetAuto-answer calls: complaints on this but another reason you need the app to disable it if you don't want it.Aut-connect: some complain that if it moves it will auto connect or cause confusion when they don't know why their bluetooth loud speakers stopped working until they realize the headphones are connected. I personally love auto connect and has never been an issue. I put my headphones away where it won't move at all and once I grab it, boom, just straightforward and smooth connection grab and go. This is a feature of auto off so if you don't want it to be doing this you can either disable auto off (more like sleep) or turn off the headphones directly from the power button (which means you will also have to turn it back on with the button). I don't think of it as a flaw to be honestDiscord/meeting calls: This is a big one. There are people mentioning how when they get on discord, their music and game sounds muffled. That is its hands free activating because it believes you are in a call. It prioritizes the call once it is activating its mic. You may have noticed it on your phone before too with music getting muffled. Problem is these then get compared directly to a gaming headset. Most gaming headsets have a usb dongle. Those dongles are designed to give both high quality low latency audio and mic signals at the same time. These? They are bluetooth headsets not specifically designed for gaming but rather for high quality audio. This is not a major fault of the headset. There exists a workaround for this but you will have to disable handsfree and rely on a different mic (which can be a far superior option anyways). To do this - on windows 11, go to settings. Click ""bluetooth & devices"". Then click on ""view more devices"" up top to go to a drop down list of devices. Scroll all the way down until you find ""more devices and printer settings"". Find the M4 headset, right click and go to properties. Click on the hardware tab. On this list, look for Name ""Momentum 4 Hands-Free"" that is under Type ""Sound, Video..."". Click once on it then click on properties below. In properties, General tab, click on the blue and yellow shield that says Change Settings. Then go to the Driver tab and Click Disable Driver. Reboot PC. Can be undone in similar method. At this point it has no headset mic active ~specifically~ on the PC (phone should be unaffected) so audio will be clear but now an external mic will be needed.Experiences:Connectivity: people say they have connectivity issues but thankfully it is very rare for me. It has a good distance to it too. I keep up to date with everything on my phoneTouchpad: some say it is very sensitive. It is certainly more sensitive than usual but there are exaggerations to it. My hair does not trigger it. Turning my head does not trigger it. I don't trigger it with a hoodie on. I don't wear beanies over it (why would you?) so I cant say anything there. Stretching my arms above my head might trigger and laying my head on the right side might make it think you want to change volume or transparency. But some of these reviews are funny. They are not rated to be water resistant at all (like most headsets) so if rain drops trigger it, actually no, WHY DO YOU EVEN HAVE IT IN THE RAIN?App: the app is fine minus the glitch [refer to High Resolution in Flaws] and has only been improving bit by bit. There's now also a new version which requires a new download that will likely be getting more of a focus onDurability: it is plastic which makes it lighter but thankfully I have not broken anything. I have bumped it into things, dropped it once. I try to treat is as glass so these are rare occurrences. I would not work out in these due to the fact they are not designed to deal with liquid. If problems occur because you work out in these, well that's your fault, but there exist rubber sweat covers to put over the padding to help out a bit. The Sennheisers Momentum 4/Sport earbuds I believe have water resistance and might be worth a look instead if you need a true gym companionStrengthsAudio quality: right out of the box, they are great. It has a neutral sound profile while having some attention to bass. There are presets in the app that are decent and it really does not need a bass booster but it exists. To be honest, I would skip everything and go straight for the sound personalization feature in the app. It's very simple to adjust, uses mostly sliders while you listen to audio. And once you are done it will create a setting that somehow manages to be far superior than what's already available in the app. It just cleans up the sound so much more to your liking; the difference is bewildering. Ever since that point, I have not listened to music the same. Just when I thought I was getting bored of music, these revived that love to want to listen to everything again and also motivated me to listen to things I never did before. There is literally pre-Sennheiser and during-Sennheiser eras to me now and am curious to their wired headsets. One thing that will become super noticeable is its soundstage. It spreads the instruments to a degree where you can notice more of everything. Albeit, this can be discombobulating and bassheads might not like the lack of sharp precision but this isn't meant to be your average linear listening experience (the Accentum Plus offers this at a much lower price). To give an example: What is Life by George Harrison. I might prefer it on the more linear style I am used to but these can separate things to the point where it is also directional and you can feel like you are standing at a concert and George is directly in the middle of it all in front of you so it feels more real- similar to as if you are becoming conscious of your own breathing. And in midst of all the chaos, you can still clearly hear George's voice and you notice ALL of the instruments more. It first gave me goosebumps how much it changed the song. Some songs are designed to be ""linear"" which could possibly affect emotional type of songs negatively but from a musical perspective, my goodness it is incredible. Now I just go back to see what music I am used to that changes with these (hint: a lot). Electronic/hip-hop music perhaps is the exception but this gives such clarity to detail that it is still a great listen- one thing is for sure these headsets love when there is a band setup (Bjork, the Roots, Gorillaz, etc). Sound quality is the biggest reason you go for these.Comfort: I can go on for a while without my ears hurting or anything. Also these don't heat up much and has proper adjustability for bigger headsLook: I have the black with copper ring and they are absolutely gorgeous. I question the longevity of the cloth on the headstrap but it makes it more beautiful than it has any business being for a plastic headsetFeatures: ANC is better than I expected. It does its job, and though it might not lead in this category, the differences are so small compared to the competition. Also drowned out what I needed it to during plane trips. And hearthrough, although I have had better, they will more than suffice to the point where I rarely have any issues hearing people. The fact that it is good at both of these is amazing for value.Battery: they can go up to nearly 60 hours, especially in standard mode. Not an exaggeration. I can go days without charging them. For this quality of headset, I don't think much of the competition comes close to this. In fact this is the mind blowing part because most other bluetooth headsets don't sound anywhere as good as these and they have half the battery life if not worse. No fears when travelling that it will die on me. In fact, it lasted me an entire week's tripSurprisesGaming: it has low enough latency. Combine that with that very clean audio and surprising directional audio this already has and wow, it performs quite well. I can actually spot details better and sometimes extra details I wasn't aware like I remember distinctly many months ago when I played Paladins, not only was I able to hear behind a wall slightly above me, but I realized it was subtle high heel sounds. I am not saying this will replace top of the line gaming headsets like steel series but if you have these and not a gaming headset, these will more than suffice.Charging: I was already enamored by the battery life but the fact is, it handles charging nearly as well. You can get hours worth per 10 minutes of charging and around an hour and a half or so it will be fully charged. That may not sound great but half of that will net you 30 hours of life which is STILL more than the competition. And the other surprise was that I accidentally discovered on the PC that you can still use it while charging - it simply appears as a different sound output you have to switch to. I thought it was weird how multiple momentum 4's appeared but when I clicked the other output, music started booming through it again. I was shocked. It already has a super long battery life with quick charging. It doesn't need it yet it has it. I have never had a headset that allows that with USB-C. Sennheiser were practically showing off at this point. So I would get a super long cable to make this comfortable during charging if you think this is a feature you will be usingThese are already the greatest -bluetooth- headsets I have ever owned under the $500 mark. I have tried out direct competitors Airpods Max (best hearthrough and good clean quality) and Sony Xm5's (amazing features and stylish) but the M4 felt like a no brainer. The max have poor battery life (under 20 hours) meanwhile these can reach close to triple that. The XM5's are light and so smooth with their features and touchpad (I loved speak to chat) but their fragility comes into question as they are notorious for the hinges breaking no matter how good you take care of them while the M4's mostly have earpads wearing down (easily replaceable). Meanwhile, guess what? The M4's imo sound better than both of them, are more comfortable than both, and can be found MUCH cheaper than both as I have seen it as low as $190. Even if, say, the Bowers & Wilkins PX8 might have slightly better audio and a better build, it's not a major difference so it is imo horrifically overpriced while this just has much higher value after sales and is an easier recommendationOverall, it absolutely bothers me just how overrated the other headsets on Amazon usually are meanwhile these get a bad impression. If you are a fan of music and you want to improve that experience with the bluetooth format at great affordability, it doesn't get better than theseRead more"

I stepped on my first ones doing some intense gardening maneuvers; in the garden is the top place I use these. I love to garden and grow a lot of our family‚Äôs food that we eat June-November & also do a lot of floral & landscaping work.  It can be exhausting, and even get a little rough if you carry too many bags of mulch at once.Here is how I use and enjoy  bone conduction headphones:What do I use them for: Evening gardeningactivities. I like them for gardening once the sun starts going down & I still have lots of work remaining. The reason for me using bone conduction in the evenings pertains to me wanting to still listen to music AND hear if anybody is coming.During the day, I‚Äôm not so concerned about someone sneaking up on me, or bothering people in the next yard by using a large speaker. Is the sun starts to go down my awareness of children going to bed in the neighborhood during the spring and summer months with their windows open leads me to need another option than a big speaker for listening to an audiobook or music or gardening.Bone Conduction like this has always worked out well for me in situations like cited above. I am now sure I don‚Äôt disturb anybody, but don‚Äôt get snuck up on from behind from behind where I  practically jump out of my skin and leave my heart racing.One thing I have found they are not good for is a several hour long road trip!Perhaps for some they will still work great in this scenario, but we had 6 adults in the same vehicle and I placed these over my ears, which isn‚Äôt where they belong. I did this as the road noise and a/c fan droned on loud plus the number of people quietly talking made sure it was hard to hear like I normally do from the bone conduction headphones. My ears got sore from the hard casing of the plastic formulation of the bone conduction ear buds.These are a good item and work very well when you position them where they were intended to be worn!It‚Äôs great to feel like I still have a safe awareness of my surroundings and don‚Äôt disturb any neighbors while I am working late hours and want to listen to an audiobook or music.Read more"

If I did I'd lose them. Break them, destroy them, the dog could eat them. Something stupid would happen. 99% of my listening is audiobooks or talking on the phone. I really can't comment about music. That being said, these are the best earbuds I've bought in the last 10 years. I sleep with them. They're durable. I roll over. Get them Tangled up while I'm sleeping and they haven't broken. I bought a backup set that I haven't even touched yet because these have been flawless. I didn't expect much out of these. There was a set that was my favorite that is no longer available. And while I did like some of the features they had, like when you join the magnets together it powered them down to save power. They were nowhere near as durable as these I've been. Those lasted me 4 5 months. I've been on. I'm going to guess 6 months on these and they've been pretty abused. I wear them everyday all day and I sleep in them. Yes I'm an audiobook addict.. I'm glad I brought it back. Upset and I hope they keep selling these. I hope the manufacturer doesn't cheapen them up. Make the wire thinner really.

I am not particularly careful with them and often leave them in the car when the resulting temperature fluctuations inherent to northeast Ohio. ¬†Despite all of my lack of care, these headphones are starting their third year, and going strong.

My office is in the back of the house, and I‚Äôve gone as far as the kitchen without any issues. I haven‚Äôt tested much beyond that, but so far, the distance is more than enough.A couple of things I don‚Äôt love:‚Ä¢ There‚Äôs no clear way to mute the mic unless you‚Äôre already on an active call. That‚Äôs super annoying when calls come in randomly and you just want to mute for a second between them.‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs comfortable, but a little awkward at first. The mic side feels heavier, and it kind of feels like it might fall off until you get used to it.‚Ä¢ It makes my ear hot after a while, so I put a thin piece of fabric between the headphone and my earlobe to avoid irritation.The volume control works well, and everything connects smoothly.

I'm betting you will. If you're music, these things are GREAT!I previously had a set of Q-20's that broke it's headband and was no longer usable. I went with an off brand and sent them back due to AM quality music. So I shopped and bought a set of Q-30's. Even though battery life is limited I gave them 5 stars for their excellent sound quality. Then I read about these Q-45's at about double the money of the Q-30's. In fact, I believe the Q-45's are the Soundcore top of the line. Still, 1/4 the price of name brands.The only thing I don't know about is the battery life and will update this review when I get a real handle on it. Either way, the sound quality is all Soundcore and they get 5 stars for their excellent sound quality. I can't even imagine spending over 500 dollars for a set of blue tooth headphones with these things around. The issues with the headband seemed to be solved even with the Q-30's, making the Q-30's the best bang for your buck. These Q-45's aren't double the Q-30's in headphone quality or anything else. In fact, you can't really tell them apart. They are on par with them at double the money.UPDATE: Battery life is very good. While I don't think it's 50 hrs, it's certainly at least double the Q-30's. And the Q-45's also use the Q-20's software engine, which announces the battery life everytime you first turn them on. A big plusBoth have the same sound cancelling ability which is excellent. I really don't see any discernible difference at all, other than battery life. If music is you? I very confidently highly recommend these headphones.Like I said at the top, when you first get them, click the bass up switch on the app and watch David Gilmour - Comfortably Numb (Live At Pompeii) on YouTube, you'll be a believer. Just watch your ears, as you can turn these up very loud.In my opinion, the only company Anker Soundcore is competing with is themselves.  I don't care what they are, you're NOT going to find better sound quality out of a pair of headphones than Soundcore. ""Oh, the Bose, are best, or the Beats are best."" No, they're not. Even 55 dollar Q-30's can easily compete with all of them. And if the bass isn't punchy enough, they all use an app that has a full equalizer that can custom calibrate it. The Q-45's have an actual bass up switch and it's all they could possibly need. Hard to beat that. And if you don't care about the app, the Q-20's are only 39 dollars today, But you do have to watch the headband, they also sound fantastic. Like I said, Soundcore is only competing against themselves.Read more"

TAGRY Wireless Earbuds Blueetooth Headphones 80Hrs Playtime Power Display IPX7 Waterproof Sport Ear Buds with Deep Bass in Ear Earphones for Running Workout Exercise Gym Black,$47.48,4.8 out of 5 stars,272,"I have had my pair of X88 sport earbuds for a couple of weeks now and I am very happy with their performance. The earhooks keep the units securely fastened in place and make them comfortable to wear. With three different sizes of eartips I found one that fit my ear channel perfectly to help block out external sounds. The multifunction buttons are easy to use and handle multiple functions. I like the carrying case as well. It clearly shows the amount of charge remaining before it has to be recharge. The earbud batteries seem to have a pretty long life as well. I find the sound to be great also.One paired, these earbuds automatically reconnect with the device it was paired with when taken out of their case. If you want to change the device you want to use them with, you may need to turn Bluetooth off on the previous device until they pair with the new device. Otherwise they will remain paired with the original device.Read more"
"Skullcandy Hesh ANC Wireless Over-Ear Bluetooth Headphones with Charging Cable, Active Noise Cancelling, Up to 22 Hrs Battery, Foldable Lightweight Design, Microphone for iPhone Android - True Black",$75.99,4.4 out of 5 stars,"1,987","I've owned a pair of the Hesh ANC headphones for 2 years now and I love them. I'm a high school student and I use these headphones literally everyday, I'm not joking when I say that. These headphones have seen everything from hot, dry climates in the desert, humid tropical climates, concert mosh pits, numerous drops and falls, and frequent water splashes and spills. I highly recommend these headphones if you're looking for something reliable, comfortable, and functional.Like everything, this pair has pros and cons. I will discuss pros and cons first, and important notes afterward. I highly recommend reading the important notes section of this review as some things I mention may effect your decision on purchasing this product.Pros:These headphones feature very comfortable memory foam ear-cushions that are water resistant and fairly wear resistant as they have never failed to maintain their shape even after heavy use. The noise cancelling is very impressive in these headphones. I have used these headphones in environments with yard work equipment whirring, loudspeakers playing music, and airshows with loud aircraft overhead, and the noise cancelling does an excellent job. Do keep in mind that noise cancelling technology has it's limitations. These limitations include the inability to completely block out all noise (not 100% deafening), the inability to successfully suppress infrequent environment noises like speech, quick noises like pops or doors closing, furniture moving, etc.. With these limitations in mind, the noise cancelling ability of these headphones is very impressive in my opinion, as it very effectively blocks out lasting tones such as the bass in (loud) music, vehicles, etc..The swiveling sections of this device allow for a very compact form factor making stowage when packing very efficient and easy. Brands like Geekria provide excellent carrying and packing cases, I have one myself that I bring with me to my bag everyday to carry my headphones and charging equipment when necessary.The Hesh ANC user interface (button panel) may appear complicated at face value, however the many functions accessible via the UI is well worth the very present yet minor learning curve. These headphones have 3 ""noise cancelling"" modes. Mode 1: Noise cancelling off, standard listening mode (muffled outside environment due to your ears being covered). Mode 2: Noise cancelling on, your environment is muffled significantly. And Mode 3: Ambient Mode. The Ambient mode uses the microphones on the headphones used for noise cancelling to monitor the sounds in your environment, and play these detected sounds back to you through the speakers. In other words, your headphones magnifies your outside environment, which removes the muffling effect the headphones have when they are in standard listening mode. With ambient mode on, your music/audio plays at the same volume as the sounds around you are, respective to your volume preferences. This mode can be useful when talking or listening to others while still listening to your music/audio of choice.Cons:The stock cushions, though comfortable, did begin to fall apart after about a 1.5 years of use. However, the cushions are replaceable. I replaced my cushions with some made by WickedCushions, a company that makes headphone cushion replacements. I recommend keeping the stock cushions, and only replacing them if necessary.Important Notes:The power button (push and hold) takes 3 seconds to power on, and about 4-5 seconds to power off. Although this isn't long, it can be annoying at times since it isn't as quick as pushing a button once or flipping a switch.The noise cancelling mode, when on, produces a ""pressurized"" feeling to the user's ears. To those with sensory perception sensitivity, I would recommend keeping this in mind.Lastly, I've experienced a strange malfunction with these headphones only twice before. In these incidents, the headphones paused music, played a loud buzzing noise for about 10-20 seconds, and then power off. However, once powering them back on, everything is normal. I do not know if this was caused by low battery, or whether or not mine are perhaps slightly faulty, but I haven't experienced this frequently, as it's only happened twice in the 2 years of use.Despite the very few cons mentioned, I very highly recommend the Hesh ANC headphones. They have been incredibly reliable for the 2 years I've had them, and I have no intention in replacing them anytime soon.Read more"

If you work in a loud environment, make sure the headphones are tightly fit around your ears so your the ear muff helps cancel out the rest of the sound before turning on ANC.Button Mapping: 2/5 the button mapping that operate the headphones was my only problem, I hate the fact that I have to long press - or + to change music, back in the days short press changes music and long press increase or decrease volume.  Long press to change music is terrible especially if you're using both of your hands to work.Color Variation: 5/5 Awesome matches my phone and phone case even added a red and black theme on my phone. Personalizing your device to your headphones is cool I'm glad it comes in different colors.Fit: 5/5 it fits really nice on the dome.Battery life: 5/5 I charged it once and it's been two whole days, I only use it during work and so far it does it job, I guess the 30hrs wasn't a marketing bluff. It's really dope especially watching people at work charging their ear piece every couple of hours.Connectivity: 5/5 fast easy and simple, works on any device with Bluetooth connection.Weight: 5/5 pretty light weight and something you can easily travel around with definitely recommend.Durability: 4/5 these headphones are very good but they aren't indestructible, if your intention is to break them they will break but if your looking forward to test the Durability wear and tear they will take a while to break and be worn out.If the company of these headphone peep my review update the button happen the short press to change music and the long press increase volume.Thank you.Read more"
"LEVN Wireless Headphones for TV Watching, TV Headphones Wireless for Seniors with Transmitter Charging Base, Hearing-impaired, No Audio Delay Blutooth 5.2, Plug and Play, Gifts for Elderly",$69.97,4.4 out of 5 stars,"1,345","I was surprised to see only a 4.4 rating on these headphones. I had bought a pair for my wife some months ago, and I liked them so much I hinted to her to order me the headphones for Father's Day. These headphones deliver a clear, crisp sound. My other headphone had distortion at certain frequencies...These have no distortion throughout (my) hearing range, which makes them perfect for listening to music. A few reviewers stated that they aren't loud enough. I suggest it could be a problem with the audio settings on their TV, because when using the optical output on my TV, I find that max volume is too loud. It is even louder when I pair it to my cellphone, and would most likely result in hearing loss if listened to for an extended period.Another feature I like is that the headphones ""pair"" automatically to the base when you turn them on, and have never failed to connect. Of course, if you want to ""pair"" them to your cellphone, you must do the Bluetooth connectivity in your phone's settings (after ending the base connection by turning the base off), just as you would any other device.For the money, these are a great product. I only manage to rate items I really like, or really hate on Amazon. These headphones are a firm ""like"".Read more"

So...must've been operator error on my end.TL;DR:  Yes.  Get the headphones.***I love listening to music at work, but I'm currently in the middle of the big-Peri (perimenopause). ¬†One of my symptoms--itchy ears, specifically IN the ear. ¬†Which means my in-ear air pods only add to the issue.

"Sennheiser Consumer Audio Momentum 4 Wireless Headphones - Bluetooth Headset for Crystal-Clear Calls with Adaptive Noise Cancellation, 60h Battery Life, Customizable Sound, White (509267)",$265.95,4.0 out of 5 stars,"7,609","5 stars to me. 4 stars all around for the average consumer due to issues I believe others will find a problem with but I have found some workarounds forI will start off with the flaws (unfortunately it has em) from my experience and some solutions. They are mostly features based. I'll also address confusions and ""negative"" experiences as there are reviews where clearly it's the people and not the headphones that are the problem yet they are giving this a worse impression that it should have. And lastly praise what it has going well for itAlso, I will highly suggest downloading the new app version called smart control PLUS and install any firmware updates. Then go adjust settings or it will have some annoyances.FlawsOn-head detection: this causes most of the headaches. For those that like to free up an ear to listen to someone talk better - make a habit of freeing your left ear and not the right. There is a sensor to detect your ear and it is only INSIDE the right earcup.  It makes a double click noise when it detects and stops detecting your ear. Unfortunately it makes a similar sound for both which is a huge flaw as you might not know if it is detecting or not sometimes. This will trigger the auto off feature if it doesn't detect you while you're listening to music. It usually pauses from the headset, but there is a possibility it can be ignored by an app and continue playing so when you put it back on you might not even know if it detected you. Another possibility is you made the mistake of pressing play from the app itself when it stops detecting you thus eventually triggering the sleep feature. You can disable auto off but I personally put it in 1 hour just in case as I would have likely readjusted my headset by that point and reset it. This goes into the next feature: auto play. It's perfectly fine on mobile but on PC it can be a nightmare as you could be listening to music, you adjust your right earcup so it pauses and when you put it back on, it might play some other video like youtube in an open browser; it depends on the programs that behave to bluetooth pause/play. So don't have so many open video/audio programs in the background. Also for those with long hair, autoplay can struggle to detect if it completely covers your right ear (some people start to think it stopped working). Overall, I just disabled autoplay while keeping auto-off enabled as I mainly use the M4 on PC, but again, it seems to work really well on mobile. Plus of course if any of these aren't necessary to you, you can simply disable it as a whole for an old fashioned headphone experience to avoid annoyances but I have gotten used to it at this point that I rarely have issues [Update: I just learned on May 2025 that as of the new firmware 2.13.42 it reads ""Improved auto-off behavior reducing unexpected behavior during calls or streaming due to misdetection in smart pause sensor"", so perhaps this section might become untrue with less flaws down the road thus hopefully improving user experience]Multi- point connection: It can and will connect to two devices that have bluetooth active after they have been paired. There are individuals that pair their headphones to everything and might experience a random connection. Unfortunately no disabling this so you have to be precise with what you want to connect this with. I only paired this to PC and mobile so it doesn't attempt to connect to anything else but in the app you can click to what else in the list want to connect to (or delete). When it detects multiple signals it will prioritize connecting to what you last used, it seems. Not an issue for me. Also, it will ALWAYS prioritize audio for the first connection of the two which will usually be the phone. This is important. If it connects to my phone first, well lets say Im on the PC listening to music, once your phone makes any kind of sound, your audio will switch to it and interrupt the music, then resume playing your PC's music. Because of this, disable useless sounds like the lock screen opening sounds because that will trigger a switch (not sure about typing sounds). I have sound on for notifications to get my attention for the phone but if that is an annoyance I would try connecting other devices (like PC) as your main device first and then phone second. That way, it will ONLY play audio on the main device (PC) in spite of your phone making noises or playing audio. I tend to disable phone bluetooth, so it isn't an issue for me what connects first anyways. Now, this is a major flaw which may have been addressed in the new firmware update and app but I have not fully tested yet so this is based on months old experience. Last flaw with this. Do not have constant audio playing on -BOTH- devices because it will cause some static to what you are listening to. No idea why this happens but sometimes the music sounds glitchy and I realize it's because my PC is playing music alongside my phone. All it takes is not having something like music playing on the second device and it gets clean.Reboot: it can be done on the power button after holding for over 15 seconds. Be careful NOT to do this if it is not your intention. I have a friend who accidentally did thisHigh resolution: app is glitched if you try to do personalized sound after enabling high resolution. It will ask you to disable high resolution before proceeding. All you have to do is go to standard mode, make your sound profile, then go back and enable High Resolution.Confusions:ANC: some people complain you can't turn off ANC. You sort of can. Old app, on the ANC slide, you put the slider in the middle. Most importantly, the new version of the app now allows to turn off ANC and might possibly increase your battery life. Oh, and some people remark of ANC randomly activating when outside. That is the wind noise reduction activating during air blowing directly to your mics. You can turn it off in ANC settings (you can also adjust transparency during phone calls there) but trust me that you don't want to hear wind transmitted into a headsetAuto-answer calls: complaints on this but another reason you need the app to disable it if you don't want it.Aut-connect: some complain that if it moves it will auto connect or cause confusion when they don't know why their bluetooth loud speakers stopped working until they realize the headphones are connected. I personally love auto connect and has never been an issue. I put my headphones away where it won't move at all and once I grab it, boom, just straightforward and smooth connection grab and go. This is a feature of auto off so if you don't want it to be doing this you can either disable auto off (more like sleep) or turn off the headphones directly from the power button (which means you will also have to turn it back on with the button). I don't think of it as a flaw to be honestDiscord/meeting calls: This is a big one. There are people mentioning how when they get on discord, their music and game sounds muffled. That is its hands free activating because it believes you are in a call. It prioritizes the call once it is activating its mic. You may have noticed it on your phone before too with music getting muffled. Problem is these then get compared directly to a gaming headset. Most gaming headsets have a usb dongle. Those dongles are designed to give both high quality low latency audio and mic signals at the same time. These? They are bluetooth headsets not specifically designed for gaming but rather for high quality audio. This is not a major fault of the headset. There exists a workaround for this but you will have to disable handsfree and rely on a different mic (which can be a far superior option anyways). To do this - on windows 11, go to settings. Click ""bluetooth & devices"". Then click on ""view more devices"" up top to go to a drop down list of devices. Scroll all the way down until you find ""more devices and printer settings"". Find the M4 headset, right click and go to properties. Click on the hardware tab. On this list, look for Name ""Momentum 4 Hands-Free"" that is under Type ""Sound, Video..."". Click once on it then click on properties below. In properties, General tab, click on the blue and yellow shield that says Change Settings. Then go to the Driver tab and Click Disable Driver. Reboot PC. Can be undone in similar method. At this point it has no headset mic active ~specifically~ on the PC (phone should be unaffected) so audio will be clear but now an external mic will be needed.Experiences:Connectivity: people say they have connectivity issues but thankfully it is very rare for me. It has a good distance to it too. I keep up to date with everything on my phoneTouchpad: some say it is very sensitive. It is certainly more sensitive than usual but there are exaggerations to it. My hair does not trigger it. Turning my head does not trigger it. I don't trigger it with a hoodie on. I don't wear beanies over it (why would you?) so I cant say anything there. Stretching my arms above my head might trigger and laying my head on the right side might make it think you want to change volume or transparency. But some of these reviews are funny. They are not rated to be water resistant at all (like most headsets) so if rain drops trigger it, actually no, WHY DO YOU EVEN HAVE IT IN THE RAIN?App: the app is fine minus the glitch [refer to High Resolution in Flaws] and has only been improving bit by bit. There's now also a new version which requires a new download that will likely be getting more of a focus onDurability: it is plastic which makes it lighter but thankfully I have not broken anything. I have bumped it into things, dropped it once. I try to treat is as glass so these are rare occurrences. I would not work out in these due to the fact they are not designed to deal with liquid. If problems occur because you work out in these, well that's your fault, but there exist rubber sweat covers to put over the padding to help out a bit. The Sennheisers Momentum 4/Sport earbuds I believe have water resistance and might be worth a look instead if you need a true gym companionStrengthsAudio quality: right out of the box, they are great. It has a neutral sound profile while having some attention to bass. There are presets in the app that are decent and it really does not need a bass booster but it exists. To be honest, I would skip everything and go straight for the sound personalization feature in the app. It's very simple to adjust, uses mostly sliders while you listen to audio. And once you are done it will create a setting that somehow manages to be far superior than what's already available in the app. It just cleans up the sound so much more to your liking; the difference is bewildering. Ever since that point, I have not listened to music the same. Just when I thought I was getting bored of music, these revived that love to want to listen to everything again and also motivated me to listen to things I never did before. There is literally pre-Sennheiser and during-Sennheiser eras to me now and am curious to their wired headsets. One thing that will become super noticeable is its soundstage. It spreads the instruments to a degree where you can notice more of everything. Albeit, this can be discombobulating and bassheads might not like the lack of sharp precision but this isn't meant to be your average linear listening experience (the Accentum Plus offers this at a much lower price). To give an example: What is Life by George Harrison. I might prefer it on the more linear style I am used to but these can separate things to the point where it is also directional and you can feel like you are standing at a concert and George is directly in the middle of it all in front of you so it feels more real- similar to as if you are becoming conscious of your own breathing. And in midst of all the chaos, you can still clearly hear George's voice and you notice ALL of the instruments more. It first gave me goosebumps how much it changed the song. Some songs are designed to be ""linear"" which could possibly affect emotional type of songs negatively but from a musical perspective, my goodness it is incredible. Now I just go back to see what music I am used to that changes with these (hint: a lot). Electronic/hip-hop music perhaps is the exception but this gives such clarity to detail that it is still a great listen- one thing is for sure these headsets love when there is a band setup (Bjork, the Roots, Gorillaz, etc). Sound quality is the biggest reason you go for these.Comfort: I can go on for a while without my ears hurting or anything. Also these don't heat up much and has proper adjustability for bigger headsLook: I have the black with copper ring and they are absolutely gorgeous. I question the longevity of the cloth on the headstrap but it makes it more beautiful than it has any business being for a plastic headsetFeatures: ANC is better than I expected. It does its job, and though it might not lead in this category, the differences are so small compared to the competition. Also drowned out what I needed it to during plane trips. And hearthrough, although I have had better, they will more than suffice to the point where I rarely have any issues hearing people. The fact that it is good at both of these is amazing for value.Battery: they can go up to nearly 60 hours, especially in standard mode. Not an exaggeration. I can go days without charging them. For this quality of headset, I don't think much of the competition comes close to this. In fact this is the mind blowing part because most other bluetooth headsets don't sound anywhere as good as these and they have half the battery life if not worse. No fears when travelling that it will die on me. In fact, it lasted me an entire week's tripSurprisesGaming: it has low enough latency. Combine that with that very clean audio and surprising directional audio this already has and wow, it performs quite well. I can actually spot details better and sometimes extra details I wasn't aware like I remember distinctly many months ago when I played Paladins, not only was I able to hear behind a wall slightly above me, but I realized it was subtle high heel sounds. I am not saying this will replace top of the line gaming headsets like steel series but if you have these and not a gaming headset, these will more than suffice.Charging: I was already enamored by the battery life but the fact is, it handles charging nearly as well. You can get hours worth per 10 minutes of charging and around an hour and a half or so it will be fully charged. That may not sound great but half of that will net you 30 hours of life which is STILL more than the competition. And the other surprise was that I accidentally discovered on the PC that you can still use it while charging - it simply appears as a different sound output you have to switch to. I thought it was weird how multiple momentum 4's appeared but when I clicked the other output, music started booming through it again. I was shocked. It already has a super long battery life with quick charging. It doesn't need it yet it has it. I have never had a headset that allows that with USB-C. Sennheiser were practically showing off at this point. So I would get a super long cable to make this comfortable during charging if you think this is a feature you will be usingThese are already the greatest -bluetooth- headsets I have ever owned under the $500 mark. I have tried out direct competitors Airpods Max (best hearthrough and good clean quality) and Sony Xm5's (amazing features and stylish) but the M4 felt like a no brainer. The max have poor battery life (under 20 hours) meanwhile these can reach close to triple that. The XM5's are light and so smooth with their features and touchpad (I loved speak to chat) but their fragility comes into question as they are notorious for the hinges breaking no matter how good you take care of them while the M4's mostly have earpads wearing down (easily replaceable). Meanwhile, guess what? The M4's imo sound better than both of them, are more comfortable than both, and can be found MUCH cheaper than both as I have seen it as low as $190. Even if, say, the Bowers & Wilkins PX8 might have slightly better audio and a better build, it's not a major difference so it is imo horrifically overpriced while this just has much higher value after sales and is an easier recommendationOverall, it absolutely bothers me just how overrated the other headsets on Amazon usually are meanwhile these get a bad impression. If you are a fan of music and you want to improve that experience with the bluetooth format at great affordability, it doesn't get better than theseRead more"

Overall, I just disabled autoplay while keeping auto-off enabled as I mainly use the M4 on PC, but again, it seems to work really well on mobile. Plus of course if any of these aren't necessary to you, you can simply disable it as a whole for an old fashioned headphone experience to avoid annoyances but I have gotten used to it at this point that I rarely have issues [Update: I just learned on May 2025 that as of the new firmware 2.13.42 it reads ""Improved auto-off behavior reducing unexpected behavior during calls or streaming due to misdetection in smart pause sensor"", so perhaps this section might become untrue with less flaws down the road thus hopefully improving user experience]Multi- point connection: It can and will connect to two devices that have bluetooth active after they have been paired. There are individuals that pair their headphones to everything and might experience a random connection. Unfortunately no disabling this so you have to be precise with what you want to connect this with. I only paired this to PC and mobile so it doesn't attempt to connect to anything else but in the app you can click to what else in the list want to connect to (or delete). When it detects multiple signals it will prioritize connecting to what you last used, it seems. Not an issue for me. Also, it will ALWAYS prioritize audio for the first connection of the two which will usually be the phone. This is important. If it connects to my phone first, well lets say Im on the PC listening to music, once your phone makes any kind of sound, your audio will switch to it and interrupt the music, then resume playing your PC's music. Because of this, disable useless sounds like the lock screen opening sounds because that will trigger a switch (not sure about typing sounds). I have sound on for notifications to get my attention for the phone but if that is an annoyance I would try connecting other devices (like PC) as your main device first and then phone second. That way, it will ONLY play audio on the main device (PC) in spite of your phone making noises or playing audio. I tend to disable phone bluetooth, so it isn't an issue for me what connects first anyways. Now, this is a major flaw which may have been addressed in the new firmware update and app but I have not fully tested yet so this is based on months old experience. Last flaw with this. Do not have constant audio playing on -BOTH- devices because it will cause some static to what you are listening to. No idea why this happens but sometimes the music sounds glitchy and I realize it's because my PC is playing music alongside my phone. All it takes is not having something like music playing on the second device and it gets clean.Reboot: it can be done on the power button after holding for over 15 seconds. Be careful NOT to do this if it is not your intention. I have a friend who accidentally did thisHigh resolution: app is glitched if you try to do personalized sound after enabling high resolution. It will ask you to disable high resolution before proceeding. All you have to do is go to standard mode, make your sound profile, then go back and enable High Resolution.Confusions:ANC: some people complain you can't turn off ANC. You sort of can. Old app, on the ANC slide, you put the slider in the middle. Most importantly, the new version of the app now allows to turn off ANC and might possibly increase your battery life. Oh, and some people remark of ANC randomly activating when outside. That is the wind noise reduction activating during air blowing directly to your mics. You can turn it off in ANC settings (you can also adjust transparency during phone calls there) but trust me that you don't want to hear wind transmitted into a headsetAuto-answer calls: complaints on this but another reason you need the app to disable it if you don't want it.Aut-connect: some complain that if it moves it will auto connect or cause confusion when they don't know why their bluetooth loud speakers stopped working until they realize the headphones are connected. I personally love auto connect and has never been an issue. I put my headphones away where it won't move at all and once I grab it, boom, just straightforward and smooth connection grab and go. This is a feature of auto off so if you don't want it to be doing this you can either disable auto off (more like sleep) or turn off the headphones directly from the power button (which means you will also have to turn it back on with the button). I don't think of it as a flaw to be honestDiscord/meeting calls: This is a big one. There are people mentioning how when they get on discord, their music and game sounds muffled. That is its hands free activating because it believes you are in a call. It prioritizes the call once it is activating its mic. You may have noticed it on your phone before too with music getting muffled. Problem is these then get compared directly to a gaming headset. Most gaming headsets have a usb dongle. Those dongles are designed to give both high quality low latency audio and mic signals at the same time. These? They are bluetooth headsets not specifically designed for gaming but rather for high quality audio. This is not a major fault of the headset. There exists a workaround for this but you will have to disable handsfree and rely on a different mic (which can be a far superior option anyways). To do this - on windows 11, go to settings. Click ""bluetooth & devices"". Then click on ""view more devices"" up top to go to a drop down list of devices. Scroll all the way down until you find ""more devices and printer settings"". Find the M4 headset, right click and go to properties. Click on the hardware tab. On this list, look for Name ""Momentum 4 Hands-Free"" that is under Type ""Sound, Video..."". Click once on it then click on properties below. In properties, General tab, click on the blue and yellow shield that says Change Settings. Then go to the Driver tab and Click Disable Driver. Reboot PC. Can be undone in similar method. At this point it has no headset mic active ~specifically~ on the PC (phone should be unaffected) so audio will be clear but now an external mic will be needed.Experiences:Connectivity: people say they have connectivity issues but thankfully it is very rare for me. It has a good distance to it too. I keep up to date with everything on my phoneTouchpad: some say it is very sensitive. It is certainly more sensitive than usual but there are exaggerations to it. My hair does not trigger it. Turning my head does not trigger it. I don't trigger it with a hoodie on. I don't wear beanies over it (why would you?) so I cant say anything there. Stretching my arms above my head might trigger and laying my head on the right side might make it think you want to change volume or transparency. But some of these reviews are funny. They are not rated to be water resistant at all (like most headsets) so if rain drops trigger it, actually no, WHY DO YOU EVEN HAVE IT IN THE RAIN?App: the app is fine minus the glitch [refer to High Resolution in Flaws] and has only been improving bit by bit. There's now also a new version which requires a new download that will likely be getting more of a focus onDurability: it is plastic which makes it lighter but thankfully I have not broken anything. I have bumped it into things, dropped it once. I try to treat is as glass so these are rare occurrences. I would not work out in these due to the fact they are not designed to deal with liquid. If problems occur because you work out in these, well that's your fault, but there exist rubber sweat covers to put over the padding to help out a bit. The Sennheisers Momentum 4/Sport earbuds I believe have water resistance and might be worth a look instead if you need a true gym companionStrengthsAudio quality: right out of the box, they are great. It has a neutral sound profile while having some attention to bass. There are presets in the app that are decent and it really does not need a bass booster but it exists. To be honest, I would skip everything and go straight for the sound personalization feature in the app. It's very simple to adjust, uses mostly sliders while you listen to audio. And once you are done it will create a setting that somehow manages to be far superior than what's already available in the app. It just cleans up the sound so much more to your liking; the difference is bewildering. Ever since that point, I have not listened to music the same. Just when I thought I was getting bored of music, these revived that love to want to listen to everything again and also motivated me to listen to things I never did before. There is literally pre-Sennheiser and during-Sennheiser eras to me now and am curious to their wired headsets. One thing that will become super noticeable is its soundstage. It spreads the instruments to a degree where you can notice more of everything. Albeit, this can be discombobulating and bassheads might not like the lack of sharp precision but this isn't meant to be your average linear listening experience (the Accentum Plus offers this at a much lower price). To give an example: What is Life by George Harrison. I might prefer it on the more linear style I am used to but these can separate things to the point where it is also directional and you can feel like you are standing at a concert and George is directly in the middle of it all in front of you so it feels more real- similar to as if you are becoming conscious of your own breathing. And in midst of all the chaos, you can still clearly hear George's voice and you notice ALL of the instruments more. It first gave me goosebumps how much it changed the song. Some songs are designed to be ""linear"" which could possibly affect emotional type of songs negatively but from a musical perspective, my goodness it is incredible. Now I just go back to see what music I am used to that changes with these (hint: a lot). Electronic/hip-hop music perhaps is the exception but this gives such clarity to detail that it is still a great listen- one thing is for sure these headsets love when there is a band setup (Bjork, the Roots, Gorillaz, etc). Sound quality is the biggest reason you go for these.Comfort: I can go on for a while without my ears hurting or anything. Also these don't heat up much and has proper adjustability for bigger headsLook: I have the black with copper ring and they are absolutely gorgeous. I question the longevity of the cloth on the headstrap but it makes it more beautiful than it has any business being for a plastic headsetFeatures: ANC is better than I expected. It does its job, and though it might not lead in this category, the differences are so small compared to the competition. Also drowned out what I needed it to during plane trips. And hearthrough, although I have had better, they will more than suffice to the point where I rarely have any issues hearing people. The fact that it is good at both of these is amazing for value.Battery: they can go up to nearly 60 hours, especially in standard mode. Not an exaggeration. I can go days without charging them. For this quality of headset, I don't think much of the competition comes close to this. In fact this is the mind blowing part because most other bluetooth headsets don't sound anywhere as good as these and they have half the battery life if not worse. No fears when travelling that it will die on me. In fact, it lasted me an entire week's tripSurprisesGaming: it has low enough latency. Combine that with that very clean audio and surprising directional audio this already has and wow, it performs quite well. I can actually spot details better and sometimes extra details I wasn't aware like I remember distinctly many months ago when I played Paladins, not only was I able to hear behind a wall slightly above me, but I realized it was subtle high heel sounds. I am not saying this will replace top of the line gaming headsets like steel series but if you have these and not a gaming headset, these will more than suffice.Charging: I was already enamored by the battery life but the fact is, it handles charging nearly as well. You can get hours worth per 10 minutes of charging and around an hour and a half or so it will be fully charged. That may not sound great but half of that will net you 30 hours of life which is STILL more than the competition. And the other surprise was that I accidentally discovered on the PC that you can still use it while charging - it simply appears as a different sound output you have to switch to. I thought it was weird how multiple momentum 4's appeared but when I clicked the other output, music started booming through it again. I was shocked. It already has a super long battery life with quick charging. It doesn't need it yet it has it. I have never had a headset that allows that with USB-C. Sennheiser were practically showing off at this point. So I would get a super long cable to make this comfortable during charging if you think this is a feature you will be usingThese are already the greatest -bluetooth- headsets I have ever owned under the $500 mark. I have tried out direct competitors Airpods Max (best hearthrough and good clean quality) and Sony Xm5's (amazing features and stylish) but the M4 felt like a no brainer. The max have poor battery life (under 20 hours) meanwhile these can reach close to triple that. The XM5's are light and so smooth with their features and touchpad (I loved speak to chat) but their fragility comes into question as they are notorious for the hinges breaking no matter how good you take care of them while the M4's mostly have earpads wearing down (easily replaceable). Meanwhile, guess what? The M4's imo sound better than both of them, are more comfortable than both, and can be found MUCH cheaper than both as I have seen it as low as $190. Even if, say, the Bowers & Wilkins PX8 might have slightly better audio and a better build, it's not a major difference so it is imo horrifically overpriced while this just has much higher value after sales and is an easier recommendationOverall, it absolutely bothers me just how overrated the other headsets on Amazon usually are meanwhile these get a bad impression. If you are a fan of music and you want to improve that experience with the bluetooth format at great affordability, it doesn't get better than theseRead more"

It was crisp and clear and I had no issues with static or interference or anything like that. The range that I can be away from the TV and still here what was going on was great. I was able to be in the kitchen with the headphones on my head and it being connected to my living room TV which is a good I'd say 30 ft away from each other.I haven't noticed any issues with the battery life. I do like that it has its own charging base that you just put them into. I also like the fact that you just plug it into the TV and it automatically connects to that tv.

Nonetheless the sound quality is amazing with tooooons of bass. These are advertised as over the ear but are kind of over, kind of on. I can't stand the sound and feeling of on ear headphones but these feel really good actually. The EQ settings are pretty useless. One is clear with great bass, the other has a lot of mid, and the other is just flat. Skip em and keep it on ""voice"" setting. Comes with a 3.5mm cable and USB-C charging cable. The color is ok, kind of yellow, kind of pinkish. A little bulky out of the corner of my eye. The fold up really nicely.

The sound is crisp and amazing bass, and makes music sound the way it was made.However, for Amazon customer service 1 star!

However, when the shipment arrived all items were included except they forgot to box the ear buds. Called to let them know about the missing item in which they told me they would have to investigate and that process could take up to 5 days. So no refund or no replacement I would have to re-order the ear buds in which I did and am I glad I did. NOW, for Amazon you guys really need to improve your service in regards to handling matters such as mine. First, the investigation I'm fine with and understand perfectly it needs to get done to prevent fraud from consumers. Talking with the first person when I called I wanted to make sure about the investigation process being done because it was a simple one at that. All that had to be done was see the time that the delivery label was printed shortly before that time you would clearly be able to see the person packing my items, and see only 3 out of the 4 items were placed in the box. Case closed! I do not appreciate having to call to check on the status and everything agents were rude and could not answer simple questions I still had about the investigation process. Now, after 4 days I called again to see the status of the investigation, for the operator to say we are issuing a refund. Why, did I not get a phone call or email letting me know about the result. Why is it me having to take time out of my day again to find out the status for a mistake your company clearly did while shipping my items. All, I was asking for is basic customer service admitting you were wrong and the very least an apology. I do not appreciate having to waste my time after not receiving an item I purchased having to go through this type of treatment. I really do not appreciate as if I was wrong and trying to commit fraud making a false claim. If this is the type of service that is consistently given, I will in the future spend more money and give my business to a company that shows appreciation.Read more"

"Sennheiser MOMENTUM 4 Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth for Crystal-Clear Calls w/Adaptive Noise Cancellation, 60h Battery Life, Customizable Sound & Lightweight Folding Design, Graphite",$265.95,4.0 out of 5 stars,"7,609","5 stars to me. 4 stars all around for the average consumer due to issues I believe others will find a problem with but I have found some workarounds forI will start off with the flaws (unfortunately it has em) from my experience and some solutions. They are mostly features based. I'll also address confusions and ""negative"" experiences as there are reviews where clearly it's the people and not the headphones that are the problem yet they are giving this a worse impression that it should have. And lastly praise what it has going well for itAlso, I will highly suggest downloading the new app version called smart control PLUS and install any firmware updates. Then go adjust settings or it will have some annoyances.FlawsOn-head detection: this causes most of the headaches. For those that like to free up an ear to listen to someone talk better - make a habit of freeing your left ear and not the right. There is a sensor to detect your ear and it is only INSIDE the right earcup.  It makes a double click noise when it detects and stops detecting your ear. Unfortunately it makes a similar sound for both which is a huge flaw as you might not know if it is detecting or not sometimes. This will trigger the auto off feature if it doesn't detect you while you're listening to music. It usually pauses from the headset, but there is a possibility it can be ignored by an app and continue playing so when you put it back on you might not even know if it detected you. Another possibility is you made the mistake of pressing play from the app itself when it stops detecting you thus eventually triggering the sleep feature. You can disable auto off but I personally put it in 1 hour just in case as I would have likely readjusted my headset by that point and reset it. This goes into the next feature: auto play. It's perfectly fine on mobile but on PC it can be a nightmare as you could be listening to music, you adjust your right earcup so it pauses and when you put it back on, it might play some other video like youtube in an open browser; it depends on the programs that behave to bluetooth pause/play. So don't have so many open video/audio programs in the background. Also for those with long hair, autoplay can struggle to detect if it completely covers your right ear (some people start to think it stopped working). Overall, I just disabled autoplay while keeping auto-off enabled as I mainly use the M4 on PC, but again, it seems to work really well on mobile. Plus of course if any of these aren't necessary to you, you can simply disable it as a whole for an old fashioned headphone experience to avoid annoyances but I have gotten used to it at this point that I rarely have issues [Update: I just learned on May 2025 that as of the new firmware 2.13.42 it reads ""Improved auto-off behavior reducing unexpected behavior during calls or streaming due to misdetection in smart pause sensor"", so perhaps this section might become untrue with less flaws down the road thus hopefully improving user experience]Multi- point connection: It can and will connect to two devices that have bluetooth active after they have been paired. There are individuals that pair their headphones to everything and might experience a random connection. Unfortunately no disabling this so you have to be precise with what you want to connect this with. I only paired this to PC and mobile so it doesn't attempt to connect to anything else but in the app you can click to what else in the list want to connect to (or delete). When it detects multiple signals it will prioritize connecting to what you last used, it seems. Not an issue for me. Also, it will ALWAYS prioritize audio for the first connection of the two which will usually be the phone. This is important. If it connects to my phone first, well lets say Im on the PC listening to music, once your phone makes any kind of sound, your audio will switch to it and interrupt the music, then resume playing your PC's music. Because of this, disable useless sounds like the lock screen opening sounds because that will trigger a switch (not sure about typing sounds). I have sound on for notifications to get my attention for the phone but if that is an annoyance I would try connecting other devices (like PC) as your main device first and then phone second. That way, it will ONLY play audio on the main device (PC) in spite of your phone making noises or playing audio. I tend to disable phone bluetooth, so it isn't an issue for me what connects first anyways. Now, this is a major flaw which may have been addressed in the new firmware update and app but I have not fully tested yet so this is based on months old experience. Last flaw with this. Do not have constant audio playing on -BOTH- devices because it will cause some static to what you are listening to. No idea why this happens but sometimes the music sounds glitchy and I realize it's because my PC is playing music alongside my phone. All it takes is not having something like music playing on the second device and it gets clean.Reboot: it can be done on the power button after holding for over 15 seconds. Be careful NOT to do this if it is not your intention. I have a friend who accidentally did thisHigh resolution: app is glitched if you try to do personalized sound after enabling high resolution. It will ask you to disable high resolution before proceeding. All you have to do is go to standard mode, make your sound profile, then go back and enable High Resolution.Confusions:ANC: some people complain you can't turn off ANC. You sort of can. Old app, on the ANC slide, you put the slider in the middle. Most importantly, the new version of the app now allows to turn off ANC and might possibly increase your battery life. Oh, and some people remark of ANC randomly activating when outside. That is the wind noise reduction activating during air blowing directly to your mics. You can turn it off in ANC settings (you can also adjust transparency during phone calls there) but trust me that you don't want to hear wind transmitted into a headsetAuto-answer calls: complaints on this but another reason you need the app to disable it if you don't want it.Aut-connect: some complain that if it moves it will auto connect or cause confusion when they don't know why their bluetooth loud speakers stopped working until they realize the headphones are connected. I personally love auto connect and has never been an issue. I put my headphones away where it won't move at all and once I grab it, boom, just straightforward and smooth connection grab and go. This is a feature of auto off so if you don't want it to be doing this you can either disable auto off (more like sleep) or turn off the headphones directly from the power button (which means you will also have to turn it back on with the button). I don't think of it as a flaw to be honestDiscord/meeting calls: This is a big one. There are people mentioning how when they get on discord, their music and game sounds muffled. That is its hands free activating because it believes you are in a call. It prioritizes the call once it is activating its mic. You may have noticed it on your phone before too with music getting muffled. Problem is these then get compared directly to a gaming headset. Most gaming headsets have a usb dongle. Those dongles are designed to give both high quality low latency audio and mic signals at the same time. These? They are bluetooth headsets not specifically designed for gaming but rather for high quality audio. This is not a major fault of the headset. There exists a workaround for this but you will have to disable handsfree and rely on a different mic (which can be a far superior option anyways). To do this - on windows 11, go to settings. Click ""bluetooth & devices"". Then click on ""view more devices"" up top to go to a drop down list of devices. Scroll all the way down until you find ""more devices and printer settings"". Find the M4 headset, right click and go to properties. Click on the hardware tab. On this list, look for Name ""Momentum 4 Hands-Free"" that is under Type ""Sound, Video..."". Click once on it then click on properties below. In properties, General tab, click on the blue and yellow shield that says Change Settings. Then go to the Driver tab and Click Disable Driver. Reboot PC. Can be undone in similar method. At this point it has no headset mic active ~specifically~ on the PC (phone should be unaffected) so audio will be clear but now an external mic will be needed.Experiences:Connectivity: people say they have connectivity issues but thankfully it is very rare for me. It has a good distance to it too. I keep up to date with everything on my phoneTouchpad: some say it is very sensitive. It is certainly more sensitive than usual but there are exaggerations to it. My hair does not trigger it. Turning my head does not trigger it. I don't trigger it with a hoodie on. I don't wear beanies over it (why would you?) so I cant say anything there. Stretching my arms above my head might trigger and laying my head on the right side might make it think you want to change volume or transparency. But some of these reviews are funny. They are not rated to be water resistant at all (like most headsets) so if rain drops trigger it, actually no, WHY DO YOU EVEN HAVE IT IN THE RAIN?App: the app is fine minus the glitch [refer to High Resolution in Flaws] and has only been improving bit by bit. There's now also a new version which requires a new download that will likely be getting more of a focus onDurability: it is plastic which makes it lighter but thankfully I have not broken anything. I have bumped it into things, dropped it once. I try to treat is as glass so these are rare occurrences. I would not work out in these due to the fact they are not designed to deal with liquid. If problems occur because you work out in these, well that's your fault, but there exist rubber sweat covers to put over the padding to help out a bit. The Sennheisers Momentum 4/Sport earbuds I believe have water resistance and might be worth a look instead if you need a true gym companionStrengthsAudio quality: right out of the box, they are great. It has a neutral sound profile while having some attention to bass. There are presets in the app that are decent and it really does not need a bass booster but it exists. To be honest, I would skip everything and go straight for the sound personalization feature in the app. It's very simple to adjust, uses mostly sliders while you listen to audio. And once you are done it will create a setting that somehow manages to be far superior than what's already available in the app. It just cleans up the sound so much more to your liking; the difference is bewildering. Ever since that point, I have not listened to music the same. Just when I thought I was getting bored of music, these revived that love to want to listen to everything again and also motivated me to listen to things I never did before. There is literally pre-Sennheiser and during-Sennheiser eras to me now and am curious to their wired headsets. One thing that will become super noticeable is its soundstage. It spreads the instruments to a degree where you can notice more of everything. Albeit, this can be discombobulating and bassheads might not like the lack of sharp precision but this isn't meant to be your average linear listening experience (the Accentum Plus offers this at a much lower price). To give an example: What is Life by George Harrison. I might prefer it on the more linear style I am used to but these can separate things to the point where it is also directional and you can feel like you are standing at a concert and George is directly in the middle of it all in front of you so it feels more real- similar to as if you are becoming conscious of your own breathing. And in midst of all the chaos, you can still clearly hear George's voice and you notice ALL of the instruments more. It first gave me goosebumps how much it changed the song. Some songs are designed to be ""linear"" which could possibly affect emotional type of songs negatively but from a musical perspective, my goodness it is incredible. Now I just go back to see what music I am used to that changes with these (hint: a lot). Electronic/hip-hop music perhaps is the exception but this gives such clarity to detail that it is still a great listen- one thing is for sure these headsets love when there is a band setup (Bjork, the Roots, Gorillaz, etc). Sound quality is the biggest reason you go for these.Comfort: I can go on for a while without my ears hurting or anything. Also these don't heat up much and has proper adjustability for bigger headsLook: I have the black with copper ring and they are absolutely gorgeous. I question the longevity of the cloth on the headstrap but it makes it more beautiful than it has any business being for a plastic headsetFeatures: ANC is better than I expected. It does its job, and though it might not lead in this category, the differences are so small compared to the competition. Also drowned out what I needed it to during plane trips. And hearthrough, although I have had better, they will more than suffice to the point where I rarely have any issues hearing people. The fact that it is good at both of these is amazing for value.Battery: they can go up to nearly 60 hours, especially in standard mode. Not an exaggeration. I can go days without charging them. For this quality of headset, I don't think much of the competition comes close to this. In fact this is the mind blowing part because most other bluetooth headsets don't sound anywhere as good as these and they have half the battery life if not worse. No fears when travelling that it will die on me. In fact, it lasted me an entire week's tripSurprisesGaming: it has low enough latency. Combine that with that very clean audio and surprising directional audio this already has and wow, it performs quite well. I can actually spot details better and sometimes extra details I wasn't aware like I remember distinctly many months ago when I played Paladins, not only was I able to hear behind a wall slightly above me, but I realized it was subtle high heel sounds. I am not saying this will replace top of the line gaming headsets like steel series but if you have these and not a gaming headset, these will more than suffice.Charging: I was already enamored by the battery life but the fact is, it handles charging nearly as well. You can get hours worth per 10 minutes of charging and around an hour and a half or so it will be fully charged. That may not sound great but half of that will net you 30 hours of life which is STILL more than the competition. And the other surprise was that I accidentally discovered on the PC that you can still use it while charging - it simply appears as a different sound output you have to switch to. I thought it was weird how multiple momentum 4's appeared but when I clicked the other output, music started booming through it again. I was shocked. It already has a super long battery life with quick charging. It doesn't need it yet it has it. I have never had a headset that allows that with USB-C. Sennheiser were practically showing off at this point. So I would get a super long cable to make this comfortable during charging if you think this is a feature you will be usingThese are already the greatest -bluetooth- headsets I have ever owned under the $500 mark. I have tried out direct competitors Airpods Max (best hearthrough and good clean quality) and Sony Xm5's (amazing features and stylish) but the M4 felt like a no brainer. The max have poor battery life (under 20 hours) meanwhile these can reach close to triple that. The XM5's are light and so smooth with their features and touchpad (I loved speak to chat) but their fragility comes into question as they are notorious for the hinges breaking no matter how good you take care of them while the M4's mostly have earpads wearing down (easily replaceable). Meanwhile, guess what? The M4's imo sound better than both of them, are more comfortable than both, and can be found MUCH cheaper than both as I have seen it as low as $190. Even if, say, the Bowers & Wilkins PX8 might have slightly better audio and a better build, it's not a major difference so it is imo horrifically overpriced while this just has much higher value after sales and is an easier recommendationOverall, it absolutely bothers me just how overrated the other headsets on Amazon usually are meanwhile these get a bad impression. If you are a fan of music and you want to improve that experience with the bluetooth format at great affordability, it doesn't get better than theseRead more"

The sound is crisp and amazing bass, and makes music sound the way it was made.However, for Amazon customer service 1 star!  Placed the order for the spring deal along with other items all in which were being delivered together in the same shipping box. However, when the shipment arrived all items were included except they forgot to box the ear buds. Called to let them know about the missing item in which they told me they would have to investigate and that process could take up to 5 days. So no refund or no replacement I would have to re-order the ear buds in which I did and am I glad I did. NOW, for Amazon you guys really need to improve your service in regards to handling matters such as mine. First, the investigation I'm fine with and understand perfectly it needs to get done to prevent fraud from consumers. Talking with the first person when I called I wanted to make sure about the investigation process being done because it was a simple one at that. All that had to be done was see the time that the delivery label was printed shortly before that time you would clearly be able to see the person packing my items, and see only 3 out of the 4 items were placed in the box. Case closed! I do not appreciate having to call to check on the status and everything agents were rude and could not answer simple questions I still had about the investigation process. Now, after 4 days I called again to see the status of the investigation, for the operator to say we are issuing a refund. Why, did I not get a phone call or email letting me know about the result. Why is it me having to take time out of my day again to find out the status for a mistake your company clearly did while shipping my items. All, I was asking for is basic customer service admitting you were wrong and the very least an apology. I do not appreciate having to waste my time after not receiving an item I purchased having to go through this type of treatment. I really do not appreciate as if I was wrong and trying to commit fraud making a false claim. If this is the type of service that is consistently given, I will in the future spend more money and give my business to a company that shows appreciation.Read more"

It‚Äôs functional, has great range, and the battery life is seriously impressive‚ÄîI used it for two full 8-hour shifts after a single charge and didn‚Äôt have to plug it in again. The sound quality is decent, but sometimes it sounds a little muffled or hard to hear clearly.I really appreciate the USB plug-in feature. I work in a call center that requires wired headsets, but this tricks the system into thinking it‚Äôs wired, which is perfect. While waiting on calls, I can walk around or even use the bathroom without clocking out or missing time‚Äîhuge plus when working from home.The range is also great. My office is in the back of the house, and I‚Äôve gone as far as the kitchen without any issues. I haven‚Äôt tested much beyond that, but so far, the distance is more than enough.A couple of things I don‚Äôt love:‚Ä¢ There‚Äôs no clear way to mute the mic unless you‚Äôre already on an active call. That‚Äôs super annoying when calls come in randomly and you just want to mute for a second between them.‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs comfortable, but a little awkward at first. The mic side feels heavier, and it kind of feels like it might fall off until you get used to it.‚Ä¢ It makes my ear hot after a while, so I put a thin piece of fabric between the headphone and my earlobe to avoid irritation.The volume control works well, and everything connects smoothly. If they could improve the mute function and mic comfort, it‚Äôd be perfect. Still, I‚Äôd recommend it for anyone working remotely who needs a reliable headset with freedom to move.Read more"

"Soundcore by Anker Liberty 4 NC Wireless Earbuds, 98.5% Noise Reduction, Adaptive Noise Cancelling to Ears and Environment, Hi-Res Sound, 50H Battery, Wireless Charging, Bluetooth 5.3",$56.99,4.2 out of 5 stars,"18,599","Absolutely blown away by the quality and suite of features offered by Anker in these earbuds for this price. These earbuds punch way above their price-range and give competitors up to twice their price a run for their money. I've been a fan of their charging products for many years and own a battery bank and wall charger that are still kicking strong almost eight years later, so I can attest to their track record of quality. Their foray into the audio world with the Soundcore line has been incredibly fruitful and reflects Anker's dedication to quality products at reasonable prices! A fantastic example of a trustworthy Chinese company that is uncompromising and doesn't sell garbage to clueless consumers.Review:To start off I will list the few gripes I have with this product. The case is a little slippery and combined with the slanted design of the lid can make quickly opening the case a little bit finicky. There is a button to press to pop open the lid but it is small enough and also very low on the case so that if I press it with my thumb, my thumb blocks the lid from opening anyways; I have to hold it in my fingertips and awkwardly press the button with my nail, or just open it with both hands. There is also no place to attach a lanyard and the only protective case on the market for it is a crappy third-party silicone one that does not fit well. Please Anker release a protective case for these!! Secondly I am personally not a fan of capacitive-touch controls as I will hit them on accident a lot when adjusting the earbuds or taking them in and out; this can be mostly avoided by pinching on the sides of the stem when grabbing them. I prefer traditional buttons but this is ultimately not a huge issue.Pairing:Supports fast-pairing so these were utterly painless and simple to pair to my S21+ in seconds. I have had no issues with connectivity; I have left my phone on my desk and gone all the way outside to check my mail and experienced no drop in connection, even using the LDAC codec. No issues with one bud unpairing, and they automatically connect when you open the case!App:Anker once again keeping the experience sane and practical with an app that is very easy to navigate and lets you very easily control all the features of these earbuds. No fluff and doesn't try too hard. I have no issues navigating these menus to find the settings I want and the most important ones are already front and center when you open the app. The touch controls are fully customizable with short press, long press, double and triple tap options to assign almost any function to.Sound Quality:Wow! I don't consider myself an audiophile by any means, but I would still put myself somewhere in between audiophile and the average consumer, as I am an avid music listener and have experience with higher-end audio equipment I use at home with my turntable. These earbuds perform exceptionally well across a range of music genres, and have great coverage of bass, mids, and treble. Vocals are clear and full and are not tinny or hollow, bass is not muddy (unless you crank it too high on the EQ) and has satisfying kick, and treble is crisp with good detail. Are there earbuds that sound even better? Yeah, but they cost 2-3x as much and these are ~80-90% as good and will impress almost anyone. THAT BEING SAID: you are not going to get this performance straight out of the box. First, I highly recommend using the ""HearID"" feature in the app to calibrate the baseline EQ for your hearing, and then applying any presets you like on top of that. Secondly, these support Samsung's LDAC Bluetooth codec BUT it is not enabled by default; you will need to find this setting in the app and turn it on. I noticed a substantial improvement in audio quality and clarity using LDAC.Active Noise-Cancelling:Another impressively good feature Anker was able to cram into these for the price. Similar to the audio quality, these punch well above their class and are 80-90% as good as something like Bose, but for 1/3rd the price. There's various settings for the ANC but 99% of the time I just leave it on the ""Adaptive"" mode and it works exceptionally well. Even walking by a busy street these will dramatically reduce the sound of passing cars to a very quiet and distant sounding windy noise. In other situations like a cafe, classroom, or public transit, these are completely isolating even when playing music at a very low volume. Transparency mode is very nice and will allow you to hear your surroundings pretty clearly, although it is a bit hollow sounding but this is a common quality compromise for latency. One special setting I find useful is ""Wind Noise Reduction"" which is extremely effective at reducing the buffeting sound of wind during a windy day or while riding a bike, on top of the regular noise-cancelling.Battery Life:The battery life on these well exceed any practical limitations for uninhibited daily use. Even at max power draw with max noise cancelling on and using the LDAC codec, these will easily last 5 hours of continuous play at medium volume. The case can fully recharge both earbuds about 5 times as it takes ~20% battery to do so. It also does so exceptionally fast; fully charging them in as little as 15-20 minutes. Even with extended daily use I have NEVER found myself needing to return them to the case when I didn't want to; periodically taking them out and placing them in the case for as little as 1-2 minutes every hour or two is enough to basically keep them above 70% charge the entire day. So without charging the case these could last me three even four days of regular use with no issue.Fit:The earbuds come with 4 different sized flange-style tips with a good range of sizes. It is worth noting however that third party tips may not fit on these as the connector is not round and is more of a rounded rectangle shape. These fit decently snug in my ears but sometimes they can wiggle a bit loose if I am moving around a lot so I don't recommend these for the gym. I also have very waxy ears so that does contribute to them being a bit slippery.Build Quality:The upside to the slanted lid design is that the earbuds are extremely easy to remove and return to the case as there is a lot of surface area exposed to grab, and the magnets that hold them are very firm so you can loosely toss them in and they will ""snap"" securely into place. The lid is also secured with magnets so there is no latch that can break easily, but is still held pretty securely closed and has never opened on accident even when dropped. Overall the build quality feels very premium. The outside of the case has a classy matte finish that doesn't easily pick up prints or smudges, with a simple recessed logo. The button on the case has a bright LED and there are two LED lights behind diffusers inside the case that light up when the case is opened and the buds are inside; this not only looks very stylish but also provides clear feedback for when the buds are properly seated and charging (I haven't had any issues with the buds not making proper contact with the terminals anyways). The earbuds themselves are also solid and very sleek and modern looking.Read more"
TAGRY Bluetooth Headphones True Wireless Earbuds 60H Playback LED Power Display Earphones with Wireless Charging Case IPX5 Waterproof in-Ear Ear buds with Mic for TV Smart Phone Laptop Computer Sports,$49.99,4.4 out of 5 stars,"74,592","Yes, my subject line sounds like that trash hyperbole you get on annoying pop-up ads on your Smartphone! And ironically, it usually has to do with ear buds. There are tons of them on the market, and everyone claims to be the best.Now, first off, I am just a customer‚Ä¶ never got any gifts or money or anything from this company, nor was asked to ‚Äúclick on a review‚Äù for a discount or whatever. No‚Ä¶ the reason for all this hallelujah chorus, is that I‚Äôm really totally both jazzed, and a bit in awe of these earbuds. I think the main mind-blowing thing about them is the price. I mean, I have a bit of experience and knowledge with this kind of technology, and frankly, these days, what ‚Äúguts‚Äù that are needed to be used to create Bluetooth ear buds is not that complex‚Ä¶ nor expensive. How company‚Äôs like Sony, Apple, Bose, etc. can charge upwards of $300 for these boarders on theft and fraud!I‚Äôve tried those ‚ÄúRolls Royce‚Äù buds, and I urge you to do the same, and then try these Tagry Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds that are literally 90% less expensive. Yes, they retail for about $35! They come in an excellent quality charge base, are extremely easy to put on, (and have three extra size buds to give you a custom fit), and most important, their sound quality, and I mean crisp highs, solid middles, and bone- rumbling base, are outstanding. I cannot understand what more you would want either using them for talk radio, podcasts, YouTube, streaming movies, or TV, or playing your Amazon Music or Spotify or iTunes playlists. And yes, if connected to your iPhone, you can make and receive calls, and the microphone in the buds are top quality.Their Bluetooth software is flawless, connecting to your iPhone, or other Bluetooth devices effortlessly. They come with a pleasant woman‚Äôs voice letting you know various messages, like which earbud is in what ear, if they are connected or turned off, your volume control (including excess volume warning), etc.I‚Äôve had these for several months, and have found the charging, which has a bright LED display and shows the individual charging of each bud, along with their percentage easy to read.And a note on their service. I‚Äôve heard horror stories of folks trying to reach the outrageously over-priced other earbud company‚Äôs for tech support, or refunds, exchanges, etc. Basically it‚Äôs nonexistent, and when you do miraculously find a phone number to call them, and get someone on the line, you have to go to the UN to find an interpreter of rare third-world languages to understand what they are saying, and they seem to be trained, not on anything to do with the product, but to make the call as useless and confusing as possible, so that you will just give up and throw their buds, and your money in the trash.Now, I did have an initial problem, after a few months, in that the base charger seemed to be slowing a bit. Tagry gives you a LIFETIME WARRANTY‚Ä¶ yes, an actually lifetime warranty, not one of those sham ‚Äúlifetime warranties‚Äù, that corrupt company‚Äôs like Hammacher Schlemmer  have.I had enrolled with Tagry, on their website, to activate my warranty as soon as I received the buds. I called Tagry when I was seeing what could be a glitch in their charging base, and yes, unlike most other companies who hide their contact numbers as if they were nuclear codes, Tagry‚Äôs support phone number is plainly printed on their manual, and to my astonishment, I immediately was connected to a good ‚Äòol American customer service person, who actually worked for the company, spoke English, and made me feel as if I was a long-ago trusted friend. They truly cared, and said they were sorry, and that there was no need to troubleshoot the base, or return it, instead, they would process an order to send me a new one.A day later, they actually called me back to let me know that the replacement had been shipped, and that I should have it in a day or so, and if not, to please call them back right away. And yes, to apologize again for any inconvenience.  The replacement arrived the very next day. And again, their warranty is indeed for a lifetime, a no questions asked replacement policy. This is how much they believe in their product, and respect their customers.So, yes. It is insane to pay more than $35 for quality Bluetooth earbuds. Last year, I sent about a dozen of these out to friends and employees, to use for personal use, and for all that Zooming going on‚Ä¶ and they love them. And none of had any problems.I‚Äôm sure you have had a plethora of bad experiences in the past few years, what with isolation, and way too much ordering on-line, finding the products you buy to be substandard, and customer service virtually non-existent. And that is why I‚Äôve spend all this time expounding on the greatest of my earbuds. Yes, I have a life. Really. But what a joy to be able to tell a story like this, rather than the kind of frustration most of us are experiencing every day!Yes, goodness and quality still exist.

"PHILIPS H6509 Wireless Headphones,Over-Ear Bluetooth Headphones with Noise Canceling Pro,Dynamic Bass,70H Battery Life,Fast Charging,Soft Ear Cups,Bluetooth 5.3, Multipoint Connectivity,App Control",$49.99,4.2 out of 5 stars,856,"First off, it's important to note that these headphones fill a niche: somebody who wants an over-ear style closed-back headset that has some degree of water/dust resistance (in this case, IP55). They probably shouldn't be the only pair of headphones you own and use. These are ideal for exercise (since they can handle sweat) or anywhere they might get hit with drops of rain or sand. You can even use them in the bathtub without worry of splashing on them (unlike most other over-ear sets), but be very careful not to submerge or drop them in the water.If you don't need the water resistance, you can find better audio quality and comfort. For home listening, I'd suggest springing a bit more for a comfortable open-back headset set, and for casual listening outside the house, high quality earbuds (which I'd also suggest springing a bit more for) are still ideal. However, my problem with earbuds is that when exercising, my ear canals tend to tighten up and they become extremely uncomfortable. This set is built to stay on your head while exercising, so it can feel a bit tight after a couple hours, but the earpads have a soft ""cooling gel"" that is better than other sets I've used, and it definitely gets more comfortable after a short break-in period. As an added bonus, the pads are removable and the outer lining is washable (although they feel pretty durable, I'm curious to see how long they last). The headband has a strip of rubber to soften the pressure, but it does feel a bit too hard and some comfort improvements could be made there. On the other hand, it feels built like a tank - they're light on your head, but still feel extremely durable. Other bonuses include a standard audio jack as an option instead of Bluetooth, big sturdy volume control buttons that aren't a pain to use like most headset controls, and an insane battery that lasts ages (I got at least the manufacturer spec of 35 hours, using them 2-3 hours a day for nearly two weeks without needing to recharge).These weren't the first pair of water-resistant cans I bought from Phillips. The previous version was the SH402, which I bought based on goodwill coming from their excellent X2 headphones I've used for years. These were an absolute travesty, with buzzing out of one side and audio quality that sounded like somebody playing music under a couch in the next room with the door closed, and I'd never returned something so fast. The A4216 set VASTLY improves on these, with very good audio quality. It's still not top-tier in the pure audio department or anything - it's a bit overly bassy with a hint of a muffled quality in the way a lot of closed-back headsets that are built to prevent audio leakage are - but it's more than good enough as a minor compromise to balance out the other benefits this set has (especially for the reasonable price), and again, if you don't need an exercise/water-resistant headset, you'd probably want to look elsewhere anyway. If you happen to be in that particular market though, I'm not sure you can really do much better than these.Read more"

A40 has two hrs less life on full charge, which drove me to the P40s -- which also wowed with its *amazing* sound vs. my old inferior pair of Jabra Elite 7 Pros at dbl the retail price. So far so good...But over time the one flaw (at least for this user) P40 had, became an issue: fitment is dirt-poor -- meaning they fall out of ears or need adjustment constantly, in my ears at least. The Jabras were already bad due to how heavy they are vs. the 2024 crop of Li-powered earbuds... but P40 despite feeling half the weight of the Jabras in-hand... fell out like I'd used too-small an earcup. Wrong, as the only size that wouldn't fail the Fit Test on the Soundcore app, did feel initially to seal correctly. The problem is the oblong design of the cups themselves -- you cannot get an oval cup to fit in a round canal and seal, again at least in my ears.So when resting on the sofa, they need minding and readjusting about once every 10m or so, just to preserve their great sound... which is a showstopper.So saw these A40s did not use an oval earcup, but a round one. Not surprisingly taking them out of the box this morning, fit *perfectly* with the same earcup size Fit Test suggested in the app for P40. To boot, the shape of the A40 differs from the Jabras (similar form factor) in that they are a bit shorter, thus stay in contact with the skin of the outer ear more closely -- leading to better retention. I can shake my head as hard as I can, and the fit stays the same -- the Jabras would be in the gutter on a run, which was frustrating as they retailed for $129, more than dbl the cost of these A40s.So were curious about 1) sound, and 2) battery life. Battery will need a few days to figure out, so will update later with more field exps... but the sound? Tbh the only difference I hear P40 vs A40... is the dynamic rage of the A40 is ever-so-slightly muddier. But the P40 won't resolve bass as well, and will clip, again ever-so-slightly, as long as you haven't cranked preamp settings thru the roof. So for the bulk of my listening (80% YT and calls, 20% music) the A40 is the better buy -- unless of course you want them to last a flight from NZ <--> HI, or UK <--> TH -- which 90% of earbuds will tap out long before the landing sequence.So far, having tuned A40 with the app... the only things I find the P40s do better, is respond to touch controls (takes a half-sec vs. virtually instantly), which is offset by the P40 touch 'area' on the earbud body being way too sensitive -- much easier to adjust the A40s in your ear w/o activating touch controls -- which to me is preferable. The case holds just as much charge in hrs-playtime, so really for my use case the A40s have it.Still like the P40s, and will defo take them on long roadtrips or flights, granted no running w/ bags in the airport's a given (which tbh it never is 100% üòÖ). So P40 will serve bedtime duty and A40s will be for the road and office (job requires lots of moving around and lots of head articulation away from eyes-horizon... which the P40s have dropped out of ears more times than I can count). Reviews for these, pls believe them when they say, it's a great buy not to be missed if you like snug fitment *and* awesome sound.Five stars; will update if any showstoppers or concerns pop up ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èUPDATE 10 FEB 25:Having tried both the P40i and A40 now a couple of weeks... I can without any reservation whatsoever endorse getting the A40 between the two.Not only is it less expensive, but the difference in ear tip design + more secure fit in my particular ears make both a secure fit when in different body positions, and doesn't sacrifice any quality of sound I can detect (P40i still feel as if it's a hybrid betw. the no-eartip, non-sealed designs, and true round-section ear-canal-sealing earbuds -- without a clear advantage over each). The only advantage P40i offers for its price tbh, is a slightly more feature-full options list in the Soundcore app, and better advertised battery life on one charge and in the case -- that's it. 10H in my use case is plenty of life, and both take less than 15m on a 2A charger to go from the 'recharge battery' warning, to 100%.Anker has a winner in the A40, by balancing the features I want, with cost. Both the fancy Liberty and P40i both seem to be less so in this regard, given the considerable premiums over A40. I'll be keeping my P40i around, as it's still a better-than-average earbuds..., but they'll be more on backup / loss duty, than daily / sports use.TL;DR:Pros: Amazing bass response for the price; nearly all the bells and whistles available in the P40i for much less cash; nearly identical and very brief charging times vs. P40i; better fit in my ear canals in all situations -- did I mention it's less cash upfront?Cons: 2H less battery life on a single charge; some options like control of normal/transparency/noise cancellation aren't customisable for each earbud, selections apply to both earbudsGet the A40. Or get two, as I'll be doing soon, so you're never interrupted on the road :DRead more"
"Bone Conduction Headphones, 2024 Upgrade Open-Ear Wireless Bluetooth Workout Headphones with Microphones, 8Hr Playtime, Waterproof Earphones for Sports, Running, Gym, Hiking, Cycling",$35.99,4.4 out of 5 stars,"1,011","This is my second pair of bone conduction headphones. I stepped on my first ones doing some intense gardening maneuvers; in the garden is the top place I use these. I love to garden and grow a lot of our family‚Äôs food that we eat June-November & also do a lot of floral & landscaping work.  It can be exhausting, and even get a little rough if you carry too many bags of mulch at once.Here is how I use and enjoy  bone conduction headphones:What do I use them for: Evening gardeningactivities. I like them for gardening once the sun starts going down & I still have lots of work remaining. The reason for me using bone conduction in the evenings pertains to me wanting to still listen to music AND hear if anybody is coming.During the day, I‚Äôm not so concerned about someone sneaking up on me, or bothering people in the next yard by using a large speaker. Is the sun starts to go down my awareness of children going to bed in the neighborhood during the spring and summer months with their windows open leads me to need another option than a big speaker for listening to an audiobook or music or gardening.Bone Conduction like this has always worked out well for me in situations like cited above. I am now sure I don‚Äôt disturb anybody, but don‚Äôt get snuck up on from behind from behind where I  practically jump out of my skin and leave my heart racing.One thing I have found they are not good for is a several hour long road trip!Perhaps for some they will still work great in this scenario, but we had 6 adults in the same vehicle and I placed these over my ears, which isn‚Äôt where they belong. I did this as the road noise and a/c fan droned on loud plus the number of people quietly talking made sure it was hard to hear like I normally do from the bone conduction headphones. My ears got sore from the hard casing of the plastic formulation of the bone conduction ear buds.These are a good item and work very well when you position them where they were intended to be worn!It‚Äôs great to feel like I still have a safe awareness of my surroundings and don‚Äôt disturb any neighbors while I am working late hours and want to listen to an audiobook or music.Read more"
"Skullcandy Hesh ANC Wireless Over-Ear Bluetooth Headphones with Charging Cable, Active Noise Cancelling, Up to 22 Hrs Battery, Foldable Lightweight Design, Microphone for iPhone Android - True Black",$75.99,4.4 out of 5 stars,"1,987","I've owned a pair of the Hesh ANC headphones for 2 years now and I love them. I'm a high school student and I use these headphones literally everyday, I'm not joking when I say that. These headphones have seen everything from hot, dry climates in the desert, humid tropical climates, concert mosh pits, numerous drops and falls, and frequent water splashes and spills. I highly recommend these headphones if you're looking for something reliable, comfortable, and functional.Like everything, this pair has pros and cons. I will discuss pros and cons first, and important notes afterward. I highly recommend reading the important notes section of this review as some things I mention may effect your decision on purchasing this product.Pros:These headphones feature very comfortable memory foam ear-cushions that are water resistant and fairly wear resistant as they have never failed to maintain their shape even after heavy use. The noise cancelling is very impressive in these headphones. I have used these headphones in environments with yard work equipment whirring, loudspeakers playing music, and airshows with loud aircraft overhead, and the noise cancelling does an excellent job. Do keep in mind that noise cancelling technology has it's limitations. These limitations include the inability to completely block out all noise (not 100% deafening), the inability to successfully suppress infrequent environment noises like speech, quick noises like pops or doors closing, furniture moving, etc.. With these limitations in mind, the noise cancelling ability of these headphones is very impressive in my opinion, as it very effectively blocks out lasting tones such as the bass in (loud) music, vehicles, etc..The swiveling sections of this device allow for a very compact form factor making stowage when packing very efficient and easy. Brands like Geekria provide excellent carrying and packing cases, I have one myself that I bring with me to my bag everyday to carry my headphones and charging equipment when necessary.The Hesh ANC user interface (button panel) may appear complicated at face value, however the many functions accessible via the UI is well worth the very present yet minor learning curve. These headphones have 3 ""noise cancelling"" modes. Mode 1: Noise cancelling off, standard listening mode (muffled outside environment due to your ears being covered). Mode 2: Noise cancelling on, your environment is muffled significantly. And Mode 3: Ambient Mode. The Ambient mode uses the microphones on the headphones used for noise cancelling to monitor the sounds in your environment, and play these detected sounds back to you through the speakers. In other words, your headphones magnifies your outside environment, which removes the muffling effect the headphones have when they are in standard listening mode. With ambient mode on, your music/audio plays at the same volume as the sounds around you are, respective to your volume preferences. This mode can be useful when talking or listening to others while still listening to your music/audio of choice.Cons:The stock cushions, though comfortable, did begin to fall apart after about a 1.5 years of use. However, the cushions are replaceable. I replaced my cushions with some made by WickedCushions, a company that makes headphone cushion replacements. I recommend keeping the stock cushions, and only replacing them if necessary.Important Notes:The power button (push and hold) takes 3 seconds to power on, and about 4-5 seconds to power off. Although this isn't long, it can be annoying at times since it isn't as quick as pushing a button once or flipping a switch.The noise cancelling mode, when on, produces a ""pressurized"" feeling to the user's ears. To those with sensory perception sensitivity, I would recommend keeping this in mind.Lastly, I've experienced a strange malfunction with these headphones only twice before. In these incidents, the headphones paused music, played a loud buzzing noise for about 10-20 seconds, and then power off. However, once powering them back on, everything is normal. I do not know if this was caused by low battery, or whether or not mine are perhaps slightly faulty, but I haven't experienced this frequently, as it's only happened twice in the 2 years of use.Despite the very few cons mentioned, I very highly recommend the Hesh ANC headphones. They have been incredibly reliable for the 2 years I've had them, and I have no intention in replacing them anytime soon.Read more"
"RUNOLIM Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Headphones, Wireless Over Ear Bluetooth Headphones with Microphone, 70H Playtime, Foldable Headphone with HiFi Audio, Deep Bass for Home Travel Office",$18.99,4.4 out of 5 stars,"6,059","So far, so good. These absolutely have ANC on/off, which is about as good as you can expect at this price point, and a passthrough mode, which there doesn't seem to be a volume control for (seemingly independent of system / headphone volume controls).A few things seem to turn off the ANC automatically, like answering a phone call, or using voice input; I'm pretty sure the hardwired mode shuts it off as well, but I'd have a double check. I'm not sure if this is a technical limitation of noise cancellation, because I'm never spending over $100 for a pair of headphones that are designed to break, from an engineering standpoint, that don't have enough extra perks to justify the cost difference.As for durability, they don't seem to be designed to fail, as I've experienced with much more expensive brands, like Logitech gaming headsets. If you mostly sleep on your back, these past the sleep test, at least so far.Sound quality wise, My e7s (Even with the old pre BT 4.0) are better. They're just a bit muddy, but not deal breakingly so. Perhaps some messing with the equalizer on my phone could remedy this. A fine trade-off for the physical bulk of the e7s.There is no pass-through charging, but the battery life seems very good, as well as the charging time. I wore them all day yesterday for the noise cancellation, taking calls, and listening to music. I have autism spectrum disorder, and I live on a high traffic road; these cut the noise down significantly. After my day of trying to push the battery, then sleeping with them on all night, they still only took roughly a half an hour to charge back to full, using a bog standard USB-C charger.They're very comfortable, especially considering my big ol' Irish Head. They fit snugly enough to not want to fall off, but I didn't feel as if I were fatiguing the plastics any. Very adjustable.The buttons are a little counterintuitively placed, but nothing I wasn't able to get used to very quickly.Read more"

"Apple AirPods Max Wireless Over-Ear Headphones, Active Noise Cancelling, Transparency Mode, Personalized Spatial Audio, Dolby Atmos, Bluetooth Headphones for iPhone ‚Äì Space Gray",$533.27,4.5 out of 5 stars,"8,122","UPDATE OCT 2023: Here is my original review which still holds true now that I have owned the Bose NC 700 for a couple of years. Last week, I bought the new Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra over-ear headphones. I added that review and comparison at the bottom.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîOriginal review‚Ä¶‚Ä¶For the past ten years I have enjoyed and been dependent upon noise canceling headphones. With that has come a journey into the audiophile community with others who are on a quest for high-fidelity sound. My journey led me to many headphones that sound absolutely pristine but none with  noise canceling and few are wireless. Until late, the Bose Noise Canceling 700 are my compromise for great sound and noise canceling in a wireless headphone. So, when Apple announced the AirPods Max, I had to try them to know how they compare to my Bose 700. Here are my conclusions so far...STYLEThe fit and finish on the AirPods Max is absolutely beautiful!  Love it much more than the Bose. I just like the way they look and feel. Before I purchased the AirPods I probably watched 50 unboxing and review videos. So, I thought I had a good idea of how they looked.  They are nicer in person.  Sleek, premium, modern and minimalistic.COMFORTComfort is about the same!  AirPods Max are definitely heavier but do not necessarily feel much heavier on he head as the weight is balanced well.  I have larger ears and the ear cups on the Bose 700 go a little deeper to make room for my ears. So, over several hours, the Bose do feel slightly more comfortable. The Bose also do not get as warm as the Apple.TRANSPARENCY MODETransparency mode, in my opinion, is actually more natural on the Bose. The Apple headphones actually amplify the sound around you a few decibles too much. In other words, things sound louder than they actually are with the transparency mode on the AirPods Max.  Also, the Bose reproduces your own voice much more naturally when in transparency mode.SOUND QUALITYSound quality at certain volume levels is almost exactly the same. Kind of unbelievable. It is as though Apple reverse engineered the Bose 700 and copied its sound signature and noice canceling to within 5 percent. There is  a definite sound quality difference though that changes with the volume level. This is all about the DSP. Of course, the digital signal processing (DSP) is called Computational Audio on the Max and Volume Optimized EQ on the Bose. This is what works differently and what accounts for sound differences dependent on the volume. Basically, the Bose sound better at 60 percent volume and below. Bose just has it dialed in so that everything sounds rich and balanced. I usually listen to music at about 55 percent volume on my iPad. So, I prefer the sound of the Bose. The sound at 60 percent and below on the AirPods Max suffers from a veiled upper midrange. An alto saxophone, for example, will sound as though it is being played behind a wooden door.Now between 60 and 70 percent volume is where both headphones sound virtually the same. It is uncanny! Both sound absolutely wonderful. Probably the best you will ever hear on wireless noise canceling headphones (yes, the Sony has an amplified and unnatural mid-bass making them sound deep but not high fidelity).At 70 percent volume and above the Bose DSP begins to lower the bass response to avoid distortion. The bass gets progressively quieter as you increase on the Bose to where there is virtually no bass at about 90 percent volume.  The AirPods Max, on the other hand, handle bass very nicely from 70 all the way up to 100 percent. In fact, they sound perfectly balanced all the way from 60 to 100 percent volume with no sound quality degradation. If there is a fault it is that the bass loses a little nuance. In other words at high volumes the bass is a little over controlled.  The softer vibrations like on the trail of a bass string get lost a little.So to summarize the sound comparisons.  The two headphones sound equal from 60 to 70 percent volume. The Bose sound bette at 60 percent volume and below. Finally, the AirPods sound better (by quite a bit, it‚Äôs not even close) at 70 percent volume and above.CONTROLSThe final comparison are the controls. Apple wins in my book.  The Digital Crown has a perfect feel to it. It rotates very smoothly with a perfect amount of resistance. It presses well also. Apple has hyper dialed-in these controls. It makes me never want to have to use the touch-pad on the Bose 700 ever again.WHICH ONE IS FOR ME?Everything is comparable on these two headphones, but in the end, sound quality at my preferred listening level wins out. Since I listen to at about 50 percent volume, the Bose continue to be he choice for me. I just have a fixed routine for when I use noise canceling headphones.Now, I am sure that Apple could probably update their firmware to adjust the computational audio in order to fix the balance issues below 60 percent volume. If they did, then the fit and finish and controls might win me back over to the AirPods Max.  But, the slight compromise in long-term comfort would cause me to hesitate a little.ONE LAST THINGOne last thing, the spatial audio is pretty Amazing. If I had to watch movies on my iPad these headphones would be a must. The surround sound effects are as good (slightly better) than my Bose home theatre system. The overall sound quality for movies is slightly less (more sterile and hollow sounding, probably because of the limited Bluetooth codec) than my Bose home theatre system.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-BOSE QUIET COMFORT ULTRA VS BOSE NC 700 (and AirPods Max)Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra HeadphonesSeveral years ago, I discovered Bose Quiet Comfort headphones.  My first pair wore the QC15 and I have owned every iteration since then.  Until now, the best of the best have been the Bose NC700 which are spectacular headphones.  Now, I find myself the proud owner of the company‚Äôs newest over-ear headset, the Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra.  After thorough comparison, I can confidently say that the new Ultra are an upgrade in every way.  There is especially one aspect which causes the Ultra to make them an absolutely must-have for music lovers.  I will get to that in a moment, but first here are my thoughts on how the NC700 and QC Ultra compare:COMFORTI am very happy to report that the Bose QC Ultra are more comfortable than the NC 700 headphones.  They are lighter, there is less clamping force and the headband distributes weight better on the top of your head.  I used to consider the NC 700 headphones as the second most comfortable pair of over-ear headphones second only to the QC45.  Well, the Ultra now take this 2nd place spot and they are almost as comfortable as the 45.  Very Great!NOISE CANCELINGYes, Bose has also improved the noise canceling.  When in quiet mode the headphones put you in a place where the world simply disappears.  Each iteration of Bose headphones through the years has improved upon the previous in this area.  The Ultra are no different.  In fact, when I was testing them out my wife was standing 3 feet from me and trying to talk to me.  I never even knew she was talking.  This has never happened with my older NC 700.SOUND QUALITYThe QC Ultra are more of a spiritual successor to the NC700 than they are the QC45.  The sound is much more similar to the NC700. What they retain is the excellent clarity and instrument separation.  The mids are just as perfectly present. Also the highs have a very pleasing ring without ever sounding harsh.  What was great on the 700 but even better on the Ultra is the bass.  Bose says that the new Ultra are now taking samples of sound inside the ear ups and then actively adjusts the bass to sound best dependent on the shape of ears, the seal of the pads, etc.  This really does make a difference.  I wear glass which compromises the acoustic seal.  The Ultra compensates for this and makes the bass sound deeper and have a greater punch than my NC700.  So, the sound signature overall is better and gets WAY better with immersive audio.  But, we are getting to that.IMMERSIVE AUDIOThis is the feature!  If you are a music lover then this is the feature which gives the biggest incentive to upgrade from the NC 700.  Music with immersive audio just sounds better.  I have several setups of actual stereo bookshelf speakers around my house.  I always preferred a good pair of music monitors over headphones.  Why?  Because you can hear and imagine the soundstage in front of you.  Good recordings place an orchestra or band members several feet from each-other as you listen.  With live listening you can hear the music spread throughout the venue and this is what immersive audio on the Quiet Comfort Headphones does.  It places the band a couple feet in front of you.  It feels like you can point to and reach out and touch the various vocalist and instruments.  It is so great!  It is exactly like advertised.  Immersive audio makes it sound like you are listening to a good pair of speakers in a room acoustically ideal for premium audio.  Now that I have heard it, I can never go back to regular headphones.CONCLUSIONThere is so much more good that I could say about the Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra headphones. The buttons are well placed and are useful - even the touch-sensitive volume slider works well enough!  The app also just works and all the needed settings are there to easily adjust.  The carrying case looks premium and is compact.  It is smaller than the NC700 case and even more compact than the QC45‚Äôs storage option.  There are some things I do not like about the headphones. For example, immersive audio for movies is still not as good or immersive as Spacial Audio on Apple‚Äôs AirPods Max when watching Dolby content.  Also, the placement and function of the buttons is different than what I am used to on the 700.  In the end though, I am ecstatic with what Bose has done in their newest iteration of Bose over-the-ear noise canceling headphones.  My NC 700 are going on eBay and I look forward to many great years with the Ultra.  Well done Bose!Read more"

"Samsung Galaxy Buds FE True Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds, Comfort and Secure in Ear Fit, Auto Switch Audio, Touch Control, Built-in Voice Assistant, Graphite [US Version, 1Yr Manufacturer Warranty]",$52.24,4.3 out of 5 stars,"5,610","I made a previous review, and I was too harsh, and I wasn't explaining anything.The Galaxy Buds FE is one of the cheapest earbuds in the Galaxy Buds line that Samsung sells. It has practically no frills, cheap earbuds, (99.99), and in some cases, you can get it for half off on sale. However, as its default MSRP of 99.99, it is facing tough competition, such as Skullcandy's Method 360 ANC, Soundcore Liberties, and Soundpeats, and also earbuds that are lower priced.--Case--Case is pretty good, it is small, practical, and well-built. I have no complaints, the plastic is fine, glossy, but gets the job done. Overall, decent.--Buds--Small buds, with a wing-tip design. Very secure, and I see no complaints with the design at all. Touch controls in both buds, and can be customized in the Samsung Wear app.-Sound quality--I have listened to many different earbuds, from JBLs, Skullcandys, and more popular Amazon brands like Soundcore and Soundpeats, as well as IEMs. I would say that these buds are good, balanced. Balanced EQ is focused on the more bassy side, yet audio clarity is clear, and for many, many people would like this sound, and I am one of those people. For people who want to hear more instruments, beats, with clear vocals, the dynamic mode is the best EQ option in the app. The dynamic focuses on the lows, so somewhat bass heavy, and also the highs, which is detail, and the medium, which is the vocals. The dynamic mode for me is great, as the instruments are well-heard, and the vocals can be easily heard. For some earbuds, they would overpower the instruments too much; and the vocals would feel more quiet; the dynamic mode for this is excellent.--ANC--Basic, non-adjustable. For earbuds in this price range, adjustable ANC is becoming more popular.--Ambient Mode--Basic, and again, non-adjustable. For earbuds in this price range, adjustable ambient mode is becoming the new norm. I wish it had this feature. There is a setting that you can adjust it, but it doesn't seem simple, unlike a slider.--Battery life--For some reason, my only flaw is the battery life. The earbuds can pack a good battery life, but the case is the killer. Samsung can create one of the best phones in the market, but for some reason, cannot figure out a way to make the battery life the best. The case always dies in my case around 2-3 days of use, I've used other earbuds that last maybe 1 week with the case, or even 1 month.Should you get it? Yes! If you are a Samsung user. I bought these to complete the ecosystem, and it is a godsend. Imagine watching a video on your phone during school, and you have to put it away, you can use your Samsung tablet, and it would instantly pair with your tablet.

"Skullcandy Crusher ANC 2 Wireless Over-Ear Bluetooth Headphones with Multi-Sensory Bass and Charging Cable, Active Noise Cancelling, Up to 60 Hours Battery, Microphone for iPhone Android - True Black",$123.49,4.7 out of 5 stars,"1,863","I initially had the Crusher ANC and had been using them for about 3 years now. I realized that they weren‚Äôt picking up the 25-40hz bass range too well. I know it‚Äôs headphones, I shouldn‚Äôt expect $1000 car audio quality from headphones, I figured though, if these can get to the mid 40s range, maybe there‚Äôs some headphones out there that CAN do a little better job picking up that 25-40 range better than these (SN, I‚Äôm an audiophile and have the ears of an audio engineer, so I want my music to always sound great and these are for the gym). A lot of the music I listen to has bass in that range. So I do my research and to my surprise, Skull Candy released the ANC 2, so I did more research and found the frequency response as low as 20hz, I‚Äôm like ok, I know it‚Äôs not going to flawlessly get down to 20hz, let‚Äôs try them out though. While they don‚Äôt play below 30hz in a fantastic manner, FOR HEADPHONES UNDER $200, they catch 20-30hz about as well as they‚Äôre going to. Most of my library doesn‚Äôt get below 30hz, so I‚Äôm a happy camper. The highs and lows are so crisp and clear and the bass is even smoother on these than the ANC. It sounds like HIGH END aftermarket truck subs! If you know anything about that, truck subs have a tighter and cleaner thump to them. I‚Äôm a fan of these headphones!Read more"

Took a flyer on these and they did not disappoint. You can see an old review I did for One Plus Buds 3 (currently selling for $95) and these compete on every level.Sound quality: Great - up there with buds going for 2x and 3x as much. They‚Äôre not as rich as some premium names but theres still a nice variety of settings to tune it to your music preferences. I found the best sound to be: Spatial Audio = off. Dynamic Sound = Dynamic Balance. EQ = Acoustic. Boom - crisp sound, heavy bass (could maybe even use a touch less but good).Features: Again, punching well above its weight. Very formidable ANC, good transparency mode, custom touch controls, low latency mode, multi-device connectivity, LDAC. Again a lot of these can‚Äôt be found on buds under $100, let alone $30. App is also simple and easy to use.Materials: Glossy buds and case similar to AirPods with the case being slightly larger.Battery life: Seems on par with what they‚Äôre advertising. We‚Äôll see how well it holds up over times but no complaints so far.Fit: Going to vary ear to ear (mine are average size I‚Äôd say) and these fit the same as AirPods to me. Nice seal even with ANC off. Probably going to be problematic for those with larger ears but that can be true with the majority of stem buds.2 cons I‚Äôd say is first the Spatial Audio is bad. Doesn‚Äôt use head tracking and the sound quality takes a hit and just becomes echoey. I can take or leave spatial so this wasn‚Äôt a big deal. The second was touched on by another reviewer but the EQ also hardly works. You can‚Äôt configure it anywhere close to the presets and there‚Äôs a huge sound discrepancy when trying to create a custom sound. Hopefully this can be fixed with an update, but as mentioned, the settings I chose fit my sound tastes well.Long story short, I got these as a cheapo backup pair with low expectations but will be recommending these to everyone, backup or daily drivers, going forward.Read more"

"RUNOLIM Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Headphones, Wireless Over Ear Bluetooth Headphones with Microphone, 70H Playtime, Foldable Headphone with HiFi Audio, Deep Bass for Home Travel Office",$18.99,4.4 out of 5 stars,"6,059","So far, so good. These absolutely have ANC on/off, which is about as good as you can expect at this price point, and a passthrough mode, which there doesn't seem to be a volume control for (seemingly independent of system / headphone volume controls).A few things seem to turn off the ANC automatically, like answering a phone call, or using voice input; I'm pretty sure the hardwired mode shuts it off as well, but I'd have a double check. I'm not sure if this is a technical limitation of noise cancellation, because I'm never spending over $100 for a pair of headphones that are designed to break, from an engineering standpoint, that don't have enough extra perks to justify the cost difference.As for durability, they don't seem to be designed to fail, as I've experienced with much more expensive brands, like Logitech gaming headsets. If you mostly sleep on your back, these past the sleep test, at least so far.Sound quality wise, My e7s (Even with the old pre BT 4.0) are better. They're just a bit muddy, but not deal breakingly so. Perhaps some messing with the equalizer on my phone could remedy this. A fine trade-off for the physical bulk of the e7s.There is no pass-through charging, but the battery life seems very good, as well as the charging time. I wore them all day yesterday for the noise cancellation, taking calls, and listening to music. I have autism spectrum disorder, and I live on a high traffic road; these cut the noise down significantly. After my day of trying to push the battery, then sleeping with them on all night, they still only took roughly a half an hour to charge back to full, using a bog standard USB-C charger.They're very comfortable, especially considering my big ol' Irish Head. They fit snugly enough to not want to fall off, but I didn't feel as if I were fatiguing the plastics any. Very adjustable.The buttons are a little counterintuitively placed, but nothing I wasn't able to get used to very quickly.Read more"

The headphones do not have a ear canal insert. Functionally, they're a small speaker that hangs off of the ear and points into the ear. Sound is acceptable, but I'm also not listening to death metal, gangster rap or sweet techno beats to fully appreciate the speaker capabilities. Range is about 30-40 feet. The headphones are really intended to connect to a nearby phone or computer. If you try to connect to a phone in your gym locker or connect to a computer while you're doing yardwork, then the rate isn't long enough. The battery life is quite long and I love how they charge in the case during transport. I charge the case once a week and they're good. The headphones are single connection only. I have to connect to my computer for a Teams call, disconnect, and connect to my phone to listen to music. It would be great if they had multiconnection capability.Read more"

"Bose QuietComfort Ultra Bluetooth Headphones, Wireless Headphones with Spatial Audio, Over Ear Noise Cancelling with Mic, Up to 24 Hours of Playtime, Lunar Blue - Limited Edition Color",,4.2 out of 5 stars,"6,997","These are not perfect as headphones go, but they are literally the nicest noise cancelling headphones that any amount of money can buy. They have their ups and downs. I'm going to talk in depth about each of these, but overall these are the best noise cancelling headphones money can buy, so even when it comes to their downsides, you can't do better.First, if you're a regular consumer, you'll be blown away by the sound quality. However, if you're an audiophile used to audiophile grade open back headphones like the Sennheiser HD800, these fall short of audiophile levels of sound quality. Let me explain why that is.Sound quality wise, the sound quality is overall spectacular, but it has two problems. Bass is way overemphasized, and the treble is rolled off. The treble issue is in my opinion the only really major flaw you have to deal with in these headphones. It's really a shame. Even with EQ, there's no good way to make up for the treble problem because the high end is just always a little lacking.Bass is massively overemphasized, but everyone seems to do that these days, and most people seem to love it. Thankfully, you can just lower the bass in the EQ and it works fine, but from an audiophile perspective it's still a mark against it. You can also raise the bass if you want to lose your hearing and cause brain damage from the thump. These things will thump so hard that it'll give you a concussion.Aside from those two downsides, instruments sound absolutely spectacular with amazing definition, separation, and clarity, it's just really unfortunate that they rolled off the treble. It'd be nice if the bass wasn't so overemphasized, but the bass at least is understandable since it seems to be what most people want. I will say however that the mid is absolutely spectacular, so there's that.Even at their best, if you're a real audiophile, these don't hold up to the sound quality of high end audiophile open back headphones by Sennheiser like the HD650 or HD800. These are consumer grade, very top end consumer grade, but they don't reach the heights of real audiophile territory. For most people though, these will blow you away.Noise cancelling wise, these are the best money can buy. I've tried other noise cancelling headphones, and these destroy everything that I've ever tried. It's a night and day difference in terms of the overall quality and effectiveness of the noise cancelling compared to other noise cancelling headphones.However, they're not totally perfect. I have a bunch of air filter fans running full blast all the time, and it reduces their volume by 90+%, but it's a little inconsistent. Some of the inconsistency comes from just how the headphones sit in my head, if I get them just right, it mutes probably 98% of the sound, but if they're just a little off, it drops to between 90-95%. Sometimes it just seems to work better than other times with no apparent explanation. 90% is still a ton of noise reduction. Be aware though that you can still hear things, they're just quiet. Like if you pass a fan while walking, you can still hear it, it's just quiet.There is sometimes a slight amount of pressure from the noise cancellation, but it's very minimal, and a lot of the time there's actually none.Next, we get into the real premium stuff. You're paying like $400 for this, so let's talk about what you're really paying for: the creature comforts and luxury that get overlooked at lower price ranges...For example, the case for these headphones is simply amazing. It feels extremely premium, it has a nice touch, it's light but durable, it has this lovely leathery material that is a joy to hold. It just feels like a million bucks. Even the zipper is nice! The internal layout is likewise spacious, protective and just overall very high quality.Same with the headphones themselves. As an object that you hold in your hand, these things simply feel incredible. They're unbelievably light, I don't know how they made it feel this light. The headband literally feels like a cloud, it almost melts in your hand. I've never felt anything like it. It is insanely soft with this beautiful smooth leather feeling, yet it doesn't collapse when you wear it. I don't even understand how that works, but it does.These are the most comfortable set of headphones I have ever put on my head by far. It feels like you're wearing a cloud. It's crazy. The clamp force is so low that I can wear these for hours and hours on end and they just feel insanely comfortable the entire time.Even just holding these headphones physically, they feel like a million bucks. Like they've got these buttery smooth moving collapsible cans, yet they feel solid and durable, and they have this lovely smooth feeling to them.These are the things you're really paying for when you pay $400. It's just all those little details and luxuries that really make it. They put a lot of luxury into the things outside the actual speakers, and it shows. They feel super premium in your hands, they're a beautiful shape, they're insanely comfortable to wear, they have this elegant simple design to them, and their case is outstanding. Seriously, if you hold the case and headphones of any of the other noise cancelling headphones in your hands, they just don't feel as nice as this.Overall, I really wish they hadn't rolled off the treble. That's its one major flaw. However, these are so good that I can't go back to anything else (other than my open back audiophile sennheisers for serious listening). These are like the ultimate casual headphones for every day use. Watching TV? Use these. Going on an airplane? Use these. Going to the gym? Use these. Going for a walk? Use these. Unless all you want to do is sit down and seriously listen to some high quality music in a quiet room with audiophile headphones, you should be using these.These are your ultimate every day use headphones. If you're a normal consumer who doesn't care about audiophile grade stuff, these will absolutely blow your mind. Even if you're an audiophile, you'll probably end up addicted to them for every day normal use. I'm kindof addicted to them myself, to be honest.Read more"

I've had earbuds that made my head and brain feel like they were vibrating, I'm not a fan of that feeling really, so I love that these ones don't do that but have the great bass still. I love the fact that they have a button so that just a small tap won't pause or change anything when you don't want it to. even for phone calls, YouTube videos, and tiktok these are great! mine came in with a battery charge of 100% as well, so you should be able to use them right away. the purple pair that had gotten stolen had come in with a 97% charge, too. they do come with a charger but no USB block, which I don't feel like it's an issue. I'm sure we all have a block for that laying around or we could use a desktop or laptop to charge them. the color is very pretty, too! i was expecting more of a purple tone to it since I ordered purple blue this time, but they're more blue. still gorgeous! I'm definitely going to be ordering more, though. i want the light green ones, too! I love all the different color options! and they're all such pretty colors. the purple ones were so bright, I do miss those ones! but I adore these ones for sure! the little screens in the case have never never lagged for me, either. you'll see when the charge is decreasing and it does alert you when it's low immediately. the screen on the right does show what is pictured and will let you know if they're unevenly charged, which sometimes I only use one earbud, so that's great to know septhow much of a charge they have. they're definitely worth the price and I do recommend them! packaging is safe and secure for them as well! there is a film to pull off that protects the case when you unbox it as well. and they do come with a little bag of rubber ear pieces of different sizes, which is also awesome! i believe there's 2-3 different sized ones in the little bag. soooo 10/10 definitely recommend!Read more"

Nonetheless the sound quality is amazing with tooooons of bass. These are advertised as over the ear but are kind of over, kind of on. I can't stand the sound and feeling of on ear headphones but these feel really good actually. The EQ settings are pretty useless. One is clear with great bass, the other has a lot of mid, and the other is just flat. Skip em and keep it on ""voice"" setting. Comes with a 3.5mm cable and USB-C charging cable. The color is ok, kind of yellow, kind of pinkish. A little bulky out of the corner of my eye. The fold up really nicely.

"Soundcore by Anker V30i Open-Ear Headphones, Ultra-Comfort, Lightweight Design, Snug Fit, Ergonomic Ear Hooks, Robust Bass, 36H Playtime, Bluetooth 5.3, App Control, Clear Calls, Wireless Earbuds",$34.99,4.3 out of 5 stars,"2,938","I LOVE these. I have bought so many pairs of headphones, trying to find the right pair. I have 6 different pairs that I have been swapping between. Over the ear, in ear buds / IEM's (my favorites), and open ear. These are my favorite open ear by far.Let me start by saying that ear buds are my preferred type of headphone, but I also have HORRIBLE (all year) seasonal allergies, so ear buds have started to cause a great deal of agitation inside of my ear canals. I also have stretched ear lobes (9/16), so a lot of headphones just don't sit right depending on what plugs I am wearing and they press into the sides of my head. These headphones solved both of those issues for me.Like others have said, these are so comfortable that you sometimes forget they are even on. The sound quality is good, more than enough in my opinion. I am not an audiophile by any means. I do prefer my IEM's as far as quality of sound goes, and of course open ear headphones won't sound as good as those when they are pressed right up into your ear drums (dramatic effect), but the sound on these is good, and the bass is good enough. I love that I can be jamming out at work and yet still hear someone approach me and not get the bejesus scared out of me.The quality of the actual headphones is good. They don't look or feel cheap, the magnet on the charging case stays closed as well (this is a bigger deal than one would think). My only (very) small issue is the touch controls are super sensitive. BUT thankfully with the app you can go in and shut those bad boys right off and not even have to deal with them. And speaking on that, these have been easy to connect to every bluetooth device I have tried, and the app is easy to install and use, it is super straightforward and you don't have to be tech savvy to figure it out.TLDR;I have allergies and stretched ears, these help alleviate the issues that come with both when wearing headphones. The sound is good, the bass is decent, and the fit is super comfortable. In my opinion, these are definitely worth the purchase. The quality is great, especially for the price point.Read more"
"LEVN [Update 2024] Wireless Headphones for TV Watching, TV Headphones Wireless for Seniors with Transmitter Charging Base, Bluetooth 5.2 No Audio Delay, 65hr Palytime, Ideal Gift for Elderly/Parents",$89.99,4.4 out of 5 stars,"1,034","I haven‚Äôt had a chance to use these headphones because there was a shortage in the included items, mainly the one item that is recommended by the seller and that would be the digital audio cable! Advertising something at a reduced price and as improved and then removing the one recommended cable from the included items list is the most dishonest things a seller can do so even if these headphones are of the best quality and I doubt that they are I would still give them a one star, even a 0 star if I could! I don‚Äôt recommend theses headphones to anyone!(Update)  After ordering a Digital optical cable for these headphones and finally getting to try them I can say that the sound is very good, the comfort of wearing them is excellent because I wear them once a day for four hours in the evening wile watching my tv. Because I have lost 64 percent of my hearing headphones have become an important part of watching my tv because I have received complaints from my neighbors about the volume.Shortly after purchasing the cable a received an email from the seller regarding the missing cable and Winni was very apologetic about the issue. It is unfortunate that a company cannot rely on their employees to do their job correctly and see too it that all of the components that are included with the product are indeed in the package. Although there could be many reasons for the mishap others than employee‚Äôs failure to do their job there‚Äôs still no excuse for missing parts. I recommend theses headphones because they are of good quality; maybe not as good as a $400. 00 pair of theater headphones but for the money they are great headphones.Update 4/19/24 I did not mention in my review that I have gone through several pairs of wireless headphones in the past and have not been very impressed with the quality and longevity of any of them and I paid over $200.00 for every one of them with the exception of these headphones. My biggest complaint is that none of them held a charge for more than 8 hours the other is none of them were comfortable. With that being said I have put these headphones to the test right away. I used them for four hours a night for four days and the still have a good enough charge to keep going although it is not recommended to drain the batteries completely so I put them back on the charger after the forth night. I am sure that the reason for this is that the headphones have an off on switch which none of the more expensive ones that I have bought did so I give them a üëç for the initiative to add such a good sense accessory. The other thing that I have noticed is that I don‚Äôt have a headache and irritated scalp after wearing them for four hours a night. Only time will tell but if these headaches last two years they will have out lasted all of my other more expensive ones and sound just as good if not better than the all the more expensive one and more comfortable than all the more expressive ones. So my question would be, why buy the more expensive ones?Read more"

"Sennheiser MOMENTUM 4 Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth for Crystal-Clear Calls w/Adaptive Noise Cancellation, 60h Battery Life, Customizable Sound & Lightweight Folding Design, Graphite",$265.95,4.0 out of 5 stars,"7,609","5 stars to me. 4 stars all around for the average consumer due to issues I believe others will find a problem with but I have found some workarounds forI will start off with the flaws (unfortunately it has em) from my experience and some solutions. They are mostly features based. I'll also address confusions and ""negative"" experiences as there are reviews where clearly it's the people and not the headphones that are the problem yet they are giving this a worse impression that it should have. And lastly praise what it has going well for itAlso, I will highly suggest downloading the new app version called smart control PLUS and install any firmware updates. Then go adjust settings or it will have some annoyances.FlawsOn-head detection: this causes most of the headaches. For those that like to free up an ear to listen to someone talk better - make a habit of freeing your left ear and not the right. There is a sensor to detect your ear and it is only INSIDE the right earcup.  It makes a double click noise when it detects and stops detecting your ear. Unfortunately it makes a similar sound for both which is a huge flaw as you might not know if it is detecting or not sometimes. This will trigger the auto off feature if it doesn't detect you while you're listening to music. It usually pauses from the headset, but there is a possibility it can be ignored by an app and continue playing so when you put it back on you might not even know if it detected you. Another possibility is you made the mistake of pressing play from the app itself when it stops detecting you thus eventually triggering the sleep feature. You can disable auto off but I personally put it in 1 hour just in case as I would have likely readjusted my headset by that point and reset it. This goes into the next feature: auto play. It's perfectly fine on mobile but on PC it can be a nightmare as you could be listening to music, you adjust your right earcup so it pauses and when you put it back on, it might play some other video like youtube in an open browser; it depends on the programs that behave to bluetooth pause/play. So don't have so many open video/audio programs in the background. Also for those with long hair, autoplay can struggle to detect if it completely covers your right ear (some people start to think it stopped working). Overall, I just disabled autoplay while keeping auto-off enabled as I mainly use the M4 on PC, but again, it seems to work really well on mobile. Plus of course if any of these aren't necessary to you, you can simply disable it as a whole for an old fashioned headphone experience to avoid annoyances but I have gotten used to it at this point that I rarely have issues [Update: I just learned on May 2025 that as of the new firmware 2.13.42 it reads ""Improved auto-off behavior reducing unexpected behavior during calls or streaming due to misdetection in smart pause sensor"", so perhaps this section might become untrue with less flaws down the road thus hopefully improving user experience]Multi- point connection: It can and will connect to two devices that have bluetooth active after they have been paired. There are individuals that pair their headphones to everything and might experience a random connection. Unfortunately no disabling this so you have to be precise with what you want to connect this with. I only paired this to PC and mobile so it doesn't attempt to connect to anything else but in the app you can click to what else in the list want to connect to (or delete). When it detects multiple signals it will prioritize connecting to what you last used, it seems. Not an issue for me. Also, it will ALWAYS prioritize audio for the first connection of the two which will usually be the phone. This is important. If it connects to my phone first, well lets say Im on the PC listening to music, once your phone makes any kind of sound, your audio will switch to it and interrupt the music, then resume playing your PC's music. Because of this, disable useless sounds like the lock screen opening sounds because that will trigger a switch (not sure about typing sounds). I have sound on for notifications to get my attention for the phone but if that is an annoyance I would try connecting other devices (like PC) as your main device first and then phone second. That way, it will ONLY play audio on the main device (PC) in spite of your phone making noises or playing audio. I tend to disable phone bluetooth, so it isn't an issue for me what connects first anyways. Now, this is a major flaw which may have been addressed in the new firmware update and app but I have not fully tested yet so this is based on months old experience. Last flaw with this. Do not have constant audio playing on -BOTH- devices because it will cause some static to what you are listening to. No idea why this happens but sometimes the music sounds glitchy and I realize it's because my PC is playing music alongside my phone. All it takes is not having something like music playing on the second device and it gets clean.Reboot: it can be done on the power button after holding for over 15 seconds. Be careful NOT to do this if it is not your intention. I have a friend who accidentally did thisHigh resolution: app is glitched if you try to do personalized sound after enabling high resolution. It will ask you to disable high resolution before proceeding. All you have to do is go to standard mode, make your sound profile, then go back and enable High Resolution.Confusions:ANC: some people complain you can't turn off ANC. You sort of can. Old app, on the ANC slide, you put the slider in the middle. Most importantly, the new version of the app now allows to turn off ANC and might possibly increase your battery life. Oh, and some people remark of ANC randomly activating when outside. That is the wind noise reduction activating during air blowing directly to your mics. You can turn it off in ANC settings (you can also adjust transparency during phone calls there) but trust me that you don't want to hear wind transmitted into a headsetAuto-answer calls: complaints on this but another reason you need the app to disable it if you don't want it.Aut-connect: some complain that if it moves it will auto connect or cause confusion when they don't know why their bluetooth loud speakers stopped working until they realize the headphones are connected. I personally love auto connect and has never been an issue. I put my headphones away where it won't move at all and once I grab it, boom, just straightforward and smooth connection grab and go. This is a feature of auto off so if you don't want it to be doing this you can either disable auto off (more like sleep) or turn off the headphones directly from the power button (which means you will also have to turn it back on with the button). I don't think of it as a flaw to be honestDiscord/meeting calls: This is a big one. There are people mentioning how when they get on discord, their music and game sounds muffled. That is its hands free activating because it believes you are in a call. It prioritizes the call once it is activating its mic. You may have noticed it on your phone before too with music getting muffled. Problem is these then get compared directly to a gaming headset. Most gaming headsets have a usb dongle. Those dongles are designed to give both high quality low latency audio and mic signals at the same time. These? They are bluetooth headsets not specifically designed for gaming but rather for high quality audio. This is not a major fault of the headset. There exists a workaround for this but you will have to disable handsfree and rely on a different mic (which can be a far superior option anyways). To do this - on windows 11, go to settings. Click ""bluetooth & devices"". Then click on ""view more devices"" up top to go to a drop down list of devices. Scroll all the way down until you find ""more devices and printer settings"". Find the M4 headset, right click and go to properties. Click on the hardware tab. On this list, look for Name ""Momentum 4 Hands-Free"" that is under Type ""Sound, Video..."". Click once on it then click on properties below. In properties, General tab, click on the blue and yellow shield that says Change Settings. Then go to the Driver tab and Click Disable Driver. Reboot PC. Can be undone in similar method. At this point it has no headset mic active ~specifically~ on the PC (phone should be unaffected) so audio will be clear but now an external mic will be needed.Experiences:Connectivity: people say they have connectivity issues but thankfully it is very rare for me. It has a good distance to it too. I keep up to date with everything on my phoneTouchpad: some say it is very sensitive. It is certainly more sensitive than usual but there are exaggerations to it. My hair does not trigger it. Turning my head does not trigger it. I don't trigger it with a hoodie on. I don't wear beanies over it (why would you?) so I cant say anything there. Stretching my arms above my head might trigger and laying my head on the right side might make it think you want to change volume or transparency. But some of these reviews are funny. They are not rated to be water resistant at all (like most headsets) so if rain drops trigger it, actually no, WHY DO YOU EVEN HAVE IT IN THE RAIN?App: the app is fine minus the glitch [refer to High Resolution in Flaws] and has only been improving bit by bit. There's now also a new version which requires a new download that will likely be getting more of a focus onDurability: it is plastic which makes it lighter but thankfully I have not broken anything. I have bumped it into things, dropped it once. I try to treat is as glass so these are rare occurrences. I would not work out in these due to the fact they are not designed to deal with liquid. If problems occur because you work out in these, well that's your fault, but there exist rubber sweat covers to put over the padding to help out a bit. The Sennheisers Momentum 4/Sport earbuds I believe have water resistance and might be worth a look instead if you need a true gym companionStrengthsAudio quality: right out of the box, they are great. It has a neutral sound profile while having some attention to bass. There are presets in the app that are decent and it really does not need a bass booster but it exists. To be honest, I would skip everything and go straight for the sound personalization feature in the app. It's very simple to adjust, uses mostly sliders while you listen to audio. And once you are done it will create a setting that somehow manages to be far superior than what's already available in the app. It just cleans up the sound so much more to your liking; the difference is bewildering. Ever since that point, I have not listened to music the same. Just when I thought I was getting bored of music, these revived that love to want to listen to everything again and also motivated me to listen to things I never did before. There is literally pre-Sennheiser and during-Sennheiser eras to me now and am curious to their wired headsets. One thing that will become super noticeable is its soundstage. It spreads the instruments to a degree where you can notice more of everything. Albeit, this can be discombobulating and bassheads might not like the lack of sharp precision but this isn't meant to be your average linear listening experience (the Accentum Plus offers this at a much lower price). To give an example: What is Life by George Harrison. I might prefer it on the more linear style I am used to but these can separate things to the point where it is also directional and you can feel like you are standing at a concert and George is directly in the middle of it all in front of you so it feels more real- similar to as if you are becoming conscious of your own breathing. And in midst of all the chaos, you can still clearly hear George's voice and you notice ALL of the instruments more. It first gave me goosebumps how much it changed the song. Some songs are designed to be ""linear"" which could possibly affect emotional type of songs negatively but from a musical perspective, my goodness it is incredible. Now I just go back to see what music I am used to that changes with these (hint: a lot). Electronic/hip-hop music perhaps is the exception but this gives such clarity to detail that it is still a great listen- one thing is for sure these headsets love when there is a band setup (Bjork, the Roots, Gorillaz, etc). Sound quality is the biggest reason you go for these.Comfort: I can go on for a while without my ears hurting or anything. Also these don't heat up much and has proper adjustability for bigger headsLook: I have the black with copper ring and they are absolutely gorgeous. I question the longevity of the cloth on the headstrap but it makes it more beautiful than it has any business being for a plastic headsetFeatures: ANC is better than I expected. It does its job, and though it might not lead in this category, the differences are so small compared to the competition. Also drowned out what I needed it to during plane trips. And hearthrough, although I have had better, they will more than suffice to the point where I rarely have any issues hearing people. The fact that it is good at both of these is amazing for value.Battery: they can go up to nearly 60 hours, especially in standard mode. Not an exaggeration. I can go days without charging them. For this quality of headset, I don't think much of the competition comes close to this. In fact this is the mind blowing part because most other bluetooth headsets don't sound anywhere as good as these and they have half the battery life if not worse. No fears when travelling that it will die on me. In fact, it lasted me an entire week's tripSurprisesGaming: it has low enough latency. Combine that with that very clean audio and surprising directional audio this already has and wow, it performs quite well. I can actually spot details better and sometimes extra details I wasn't aware like I remember distinctly many months ago when I played Paladins, not only was I able to hear behind a wall slightly above me, but I realized it was subtle high heel sounds. I am not saying this will replace top of the line gaming headsets like steel series but if you have these and not a gaming headset, these will more than suffice.Charging: I was already enamored by the battery life but the fact is, it handles charging nearly as well. You can get hours worth per 10 minutes of charging and around an hour and a half or so it will be fully charged. That may not sound great but half of that will net you 30 hours of life which is STILL more than the competition. And the other surprise was that I accidentally discovered on the PC that you can still use it while charging - it simply appears as a different sound output you have to switch to. I thought it was weird how multiple momentum 4's appeared but when I clicked the other output, music started booming through it again. I was shocked. It already has a super long battery life with quick charging. It doesn't need it yet it has it. I have never had a headset that allows that with USB-C. Sennheiser were practically showing off at this point. So I would get a super long cable to make this comfortable during charging if you think this is a feature you will be usingThese are already the greatest -bluetooth- headsets I have ever owned under the $500 mark. I have tried out direct competitors Airpods Max (best hearthrough and good clean quality) and Sony Xm5's (amazing features and stylish) but the M4 felt like a no brainer. The max have poor battery life (under 20 hours) meanwhile these can reach close to triple that. The XM5's are light and so smooth with their features and touchpad (I loved speak to chat) but their fragility comes into question as they are notorious for the hinges breaking no matter how good you take care of them while the M4's mostly have earpads wearing down (easily replaceable). Meanwhile, guess what? The M4's imo sound better than both of them, are more comfortable than both, and can be found MUCH cheaper than both as I have seen it as low as $190. Even if, say, the Bowers & Wilkins PX8 might have slightly better audio and a better build, it's not a major difference so it is imo horrifically overpriced while this just has much higher value after sales and is an easier recommendationOverall, it absolutely bothers me just how overrated the other headsets on Amazon usually are meanwhile these get a bad impression. If you are a fan of music and you want to improve that experience with the bluetooth format at great affordability, it doesn't get better than theseRead more"

"Soundcore Liberty 4 Pro by Anker, Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds, 7-Sensor and Real-Time Adaptive Noise Cancelling, 2√ó Faster Charging, Studio-Level Hi-Fi Music, Clear Calls with 6 Mics and AI",$85.49,4.3 out of 5 stars,"1,251","I‚Äôm a 43-year-old guy with decent hearing, no major loss, just some natural decline with age, and I use earbuds daily for running, working out, housework, calls, and the occasional moment of peace from the chaos of parenting. I previously used the Soundcore P3 earbuds, which I really liked, but I lost one of them and needed a replacement. After some research, I landed on the Soundcore Liberty 4 Pro, and I‚Äôm genuinely impressed with how much of an upgrade these are across the board.Sound and Noise CancellationThe sound quality is fantastic. Music and podcasts come through loud, crisp, and full of detail. Bass is strong but not overwhelming, and vocals are clear and clean. Whether I‚Äôm zoning out during a treadmill run or catching up on a podcast while folding laundry, I never have to crank the volume just to hear what‚Äôs going on.The adaptive noise cancelling (ANC) is a huge highlight. It automatically adjusts to your environment, and you can also manually choose from ten levels of noise cancellation in the app or case. I‚Äôve set it up so I use:- Passthrough mode for outdoor runs (so I can still hear traffic),- Full ANC for the gym or treadmill,- And sometimes just to block out the kids and grab a little quiet.- The transitions between modes are smooth, and the app makes it easy to switch.Fit and ComfortRight out of the box, the default tips fit well, but Anker includes five extra sizes, which is a nice touch. The earbuds have stayed in place securely during my runs and gym sessions, no slipping or loosening at all. They‚Äôre also surprisingly comfortable even for extended wear. No ear fatigue after hours of use.Controls and CustomizationThe physical buttons are one of my favorite features. My old P3s used touch controls, and I was always accidentally changing songs or adjusting volume with a brush of my hand. These mechanical buttons are much more precise, no more accidental skips mid-run. I customized the controls using the Soundcore app:- Long press: Switch between passthrough and full ANC- Single tap: Volume up (right) / Volume down (left)- Double tap: Play/pause- Triple tap: Next (right) / Previous track (left)Everything is responsive, and I love that I can tailor it exactly to how I use the earbuds.App IntegrationThe Soundcore app adds a lot of functionality. Besides ANC and button customization, I ran the sound test (HearID) to personalize the audio to my hearing. It made a subtle but noticeable difference in clarity and balance. The app also lets you check battery levels, change EQ settings, and get firmware updates.Call QualityI made a call while doing dishes, with water running in the background, and my wife said she couldn‚Äôt hear the water at all. I could hear her clearly, too. The six-mic setup with AI noise reduction clearly works, these are some of the best call-quality earbuds I‚Äôve used.Battery Life and ChargingBattery life is solid. I used them for about 4 hours straight, 2 hours of full ANC on the treadmill and 2 hours of housework, and they only dropped from 100% to 35%. That's impressive considering ANC was on the entire time.The fast charging is also a win. A quick 10-minute top-up gives me plenty of use time. The case has a digital readout showing the battery percentage, which is way more useful than trying to guess from a blinking light.Maybe I'm old, and this feature is standard, but when I take one of the earbuds, it pauses what I'm listening to, then when I put it back, it starts again. I thought that was a cool feature.What‚Äôs in the BoxInside the package:- The earbuds and charging case (USB-A to USB-C)- Five extra sets of tips for different ear sizes- A USB-A to USB-C cable- An instruction manualDrawbacksThe charging case is a little larger than I‚Äôm used to. It‚Äôs still pocketable, but definitely bulkier than the P3‚Äôs case.The sliding mechanism on the case lid takes a little getting used to. It‚Äôs secure, but feels different than the usual flip-top design.While I prefer the physical buttons to touch controls, I do wonder how well they‚Äôll hold up long term with repeated use. So far, though, they‚Äôre working great.The charging cable they include is very short. It‚Äôs fine if you‚Äôre plugging into a laptop, but less convenient if your outlet is lower on the wall or further away.Final VerdictIf you're someone who‚Äôs active, listens to music and podcasts daily, takes calls on the go, and values sound quality, noise cancellation, and control customization, these are a fantastic choice. They‚Äôre a definite step up from the P3s and hold their own against higher-end earbuds at a much more reasonable price.Would highly recommend, especially if you're looking for earbuds that can keep up with both your workouts and your everyday life.Read more"
"JLab Rewind 2 Wireless Retro Headphones, 20+ Hours Playtime, App Support, Bluetooth Multipoint + Wireless Sharing, Custom EQ3 Sound, Music Controls, Throwback 80s 90s Design, Black",$17.49,4.2 out of 5 stars,"12,170","All midrange and treble. That's what you're getting with the JLab Rewind 2 headphones. Some bass is audible, but only barely. Sub-bass is nonexistent. It's very similar to the sound of the headphones that came bundled with consumer-grade portable cassette and CD players in the 1990s. If a ""retro"" look and sound is what JLab were after, they nailed it. These headphones sound thoroughly unimpressive, and should not be the only pair of headphones you listen to music on.Everything else about them is fantastic.‚Ä¢ They're so lightweight that their on-ear design is not uncomfortable even after wearing them for hours. I'm putting this first because there are very few other on-ear headphones I can stand to wear for more than an hour at a time.‚Ä¢ The Bluetooth implementation is somehow better than many other pairs of much more expensive and ""feature-packed"" wireless earbuds and headphones I own. So far, I've paired them with my iPhone and a Lenovo laptop on Linux, and they just connect every single time without a fight. I can have both devices connected at the same time, and I can easily switch which one is playing audio without having to solve a puzzle in some app or ritualistically turn Bluetooth on and off until it starts working. No random audio dropouts during playback, and the headphones still receive well when my phone is in my pocket. Pairing and connecting has been so easy and reliable that it has refueled my frustration with other headphones and earbuds I own!‚Ä¢ I bought the ""2nd Gen"" version specifically for the USB Type-C charging port, which is in an awkward but functional location. I've been able to charge these with every power source I've tried (both with and without the Power Delivery specification).‚Ä¢ At least twice, I've fallen asleep while wearing them in bed and woke up the next morning with music still playing softly in my ears. So I can't comment on the actual battery life, because I haven't managed to drain them completely yet. At the low volumes I use them for, the 20+ hours advertised seems easily achievable.‚Ä¢ They are absurdly cheap. Some will say ""you get what you pay for,"" and I would have reviewed them more harshly if they were less of a bargain, but they ARE a bargain. Of course, that comes at the cost of durability. Aside from the metal headband, they're made of inflexible plastic (looks and feels like ABS), so it probably wouldn't take much to break them, but they feel sturdy enough to survive if they're handled gently.I would recommend these for spoken-word content where absolute fidelity isn't necessary, such as podcasts and audiobooks. Keep in mind: their design allows outside sound to enter your ears around them, so they're best for quiet environments where you still want to be able to hear things around you (like a home office).One last thing: do yourself a favor and install the app so you can customize the EQ. The factory presets don't really improve the sound of these headphones. I got the best results leaving the EQ as flat a possible and cutting out some of the upper mids and treble (subtract a notch or two on every band above 1 kHz) to compensate for the lack of power in the low frequencies.Read more"

"Bluetooth Headphones, Wireless Earbuds IPX7 Waterproof Bluetooth 5.3 Headphones with 16Hrs Playtime Stereo Bass Headsets with Mic Running Headsets with Earhooks for Sports Running Workout",$15.99,4.3 out of 5 stars,"2,454","Updated review: My first pair quit working at about 10 weeks, so I was very disappointed because for those 10 weeks they sounded great and were my favorite headphones since I can't even remember. They fit well and were comfy, didn't make my inner ear sore after a few hours of use like most others do, and the sound balance and clarity is excellent. The company reached out immediately after I posted my frustrated review noting the headphones stopped working, and they offered to replace them at no cost. The new headphones arrived just two days later and work great, and I'm especially pleased at the fast and friendly service without even filing for a replacement -- Sunny was extremely helpful and knowledgable, and I appreciate how much the seller cared about making the customer feel happy with the product and also the experience.Read more"

I realized that they weren‚Äôt picking up the 25-40hz bass range too well. I know it‚Äôs headphones, I shouldn‚Äôt expect $1000 car audio quality from headphones, I figured though, if these can get to the mid 40s range, maybe there‚Äôs some headphones out there that CAN do a little better job picking up that 25-40 range better than these (SN, I‚Äôm an audiophile and have the ears of an audio engineer, so I want my music to always sound great and these are for the gym). A lot of the music I listen to has bass in that range. So I do my research and to my surprise, Skull Candy released the ANC 2, so I did more research and found the frequency response as low as 20hz, I‚Äôm like ok, I know it‚Äôs not going to flawlessly get down to 20hz, let‚Äôs try them out though. While they don‚Äôt play below 30hz in a fantastic manner, FOR HEADPHONES UNDER $200, they catch 20-30hz about as well as they‚Äôre going to. Most of my library doesn‚Äôt get below 30hz, so I‚Äôm a happy camper. The highs and lows are so crisp and clear and the bass is even smoother on these than the ANC.

I got them at 630pm charged em for maybe n hour put em on around 730ish and fell asleep with em in and they were at 10% at 10am the next morning. I'm really impressed with the battery life and the fact that I can use either my right or left earbud by themselves and that function isn't only for the right one was a very nice surprise because I use them while at work and can only typically use 1 at a time so when one dies I can just use the other. Haven't bought a pair that does that yet so it's new to me. I enjoy the sound quality and noise cancelling. The sound quality in my honest opinion isnt crazy out of this world but it is really decent. I'm actually impressed by these little things I love the way they fit in my ears, I was contemplating getting over the ear ones because of the way in the ear ones feel and fall out but these ones fit really nicely n snug in my ears so it adds a decent element to the noise cancelling. I love the app and that I can choose what each bud does for the tapping feature. Love the white noise options and how clear the phone calls are. Honestly a W for the price and the quality. You really cannot go wrong for $20. I highly recommend if your on the fence about it these are a solid choice for real.Update 3 weeks laterBoth still work perfectly. I found the battery life is just insane. I start wearing them around 7am and don't get the ""soundcore buds battery at 10%"" alert until literally 9 or 10pm. I also found that I can leave my phone inside take my dogs outside and they don't disconnect. Really sweet range and I have not had one single sound glitch or issue at all. For $20.. I'm incredibly happy with these. Usually with other earbuds I've bought for $40 or more the left one dies within the first week. I end up having glitches and the range is always dog shxt. I barely walk out the door and they disconnect and the battery life seems to die on the other ones more each week. It's like I can wear them n hour less and now they barely last 2 hours and takes forever to charge only 3 months of having them. I'd say the soundcore earbuds blow the more expensive ones out the water. The charging case charges quickly and hold charge incredibly well. I maybe have charged them 3x. If you drain em til dead and charge the case for like 10-20 mins they'll last you til the next day it's crazy. I Highly recommend you literally cannot beat the quality for the price.Read more"

"Active Noise Cancelling Headphones, Wireless Over Ear Bluetooth Headphones with Microphone, Transparency Mode, 70H Playtime, Hi-Res Audio, Deep Bass, Bluetooth 5.3, Lightweight Design,Black",$16.99,4.4 out of 5 stars,937,"The product works as intended. It does everything it claims to do and does it well. I find that the noise cancelation is best at filtering out repetitive sounds (car engine while driving, washing machine, etc) but also does a good job at filtering out voices. It may not be completely silent with voices, but it significantly lowers the volume of what you otherwise would be hearing, and that's if you are only using the ANC. I used the noise cancelation feature on a road trip and it cut out 99% of the car noise alone, and if I had music or anything playing from the headphones, I could not hear the car or anyone else at all. The headphones themselves are comfortable (both with the padding and their adjustable size), have a long battery life, and are easy to use. Plus if the battery does run out, they still work with a wired connection. The only thing I could think of that would make these better is if they had a stronger bass. But that is a personal preference and not one that was advertised as a feature, so all in all 10/10 product it stays true to what is advertised about it and performs very well.Read more"

They sound pretty good, the fit is comfortable, and the case is nicely designed. I'd give them a thumbs up.Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the good and bad:What I like:-They‚Äôre small and compact. They‚Äôre easy to carry around in my pants pocket.-The quality and the design are both great. Tozo is well known for making high-quality earbuds, and these are no exception. They have a premium feel and look in my hand, and the matte black color of the case prevents fingerprints from showing. The LCD screen makes it easy to see how much battery I have left and when it's time to charge it. The earbuds are also easy to take out of the case.-The sound quality is good. The music sounds crisp and clear. The ANC works well at blocking out ambient noise, which makes phone calls or listening to music more enjoyable. I haven‚Äôt spent much time with the app, but the fact that I can use it to customize the earbuds is a bonus.-The Bluetooth connection is simple to set up. It‚Äôs fast, has a wide range, and automatically connects to my phone when I take the buds out of the case.-The earbuds come with multiple sizes of rubber ear inserts to find the best fit. There‚Äôs also a USB-C charging cable.What I don't like:-After wearing them for a few hours, the buds don‚Äôt stay in my ears very well. They tend to fall out. I think the moisture that builds up in my ear canal is causing the issue, but I‚Äôm not sure.-They don‚Äôt have wireless charging, so I still have to plug them in to charge.-The buds aren't comfortable for extended periods of time. The first couple of hours are fine, but after that, they start to hurt my ears. I tried the different rubber inserts, but that didn't help. It‚Äôs probably just me because I have small ears, but it still is a slight negative.I still recommend these earbuds because they're affordable and you get a lot for your money. Give them a try, you won't be disappointed.Read more"

I've had earbuds that made my head and brain feel like they were vibrating, I'm not a fan of that feeling really, so I love that these ones don't do that but have the great bass still. I love the fact that they have a button so that just a small tap won't pause or change anything when you don't want it to. even for phone calls, YouTube videos, and tiktok these are great! mine came in with a battery charge of 100% as well, so you should be able to use them right away. the purple pair that had gotten stolen had come in with a 97% charge, too. they do come with a charger but no USB block, which I don't feel like it's an issue. I'm sure we all have a block for that laying around or we could use a desktop or laptop to charge them. the color is very pretty, too! i was expecting more of a purple tone to it since I ordered purple blue this time, but they're more blue. still gorgeous! I'm definitely going to be ordering more, though. i want the light green ones, too! I love all the different color options! and they're all such pretty colors. the purple ones were so bright, I do miss those ones! but I adore these ones for sure! the little screens in the case have never never lagged for me, either. you'll see when the charge is decreasing and it does alert you when it's low immediately. the screen on the right does show what is pictured and will let you know if they're unevenly charged, which sometimes I only use one earbud, so that's great to know septhow much of a charge they have. they're definitely worth the price and I do recommend them! packaging is safe and secure for them as well! there is a film to pull off that protects the case when you unbox it as well. and they do come with a little bag of rubber ear pieces of different sizes, which is also awesome! i believe there's 2-3 different sized ones in the little bag. soooo 10/10 definitely recommend!Read more"
"Baseus Bass BP1 Pro Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds, Real-Time Adaptive Noise Cancelling, Adaptive Active EQ, LDAC Hi-Res Sound, 6-Mic AI Clear Calls, 55H Playtime, IP55 Waterproof, Bluetooth 6.0",$27.98,4.6 out of 5 stars,53,"Boy talk about bang for buck. Took a flyer on these and they did not disappoint. You can see an old review I did for One Plus Buds 3 (currently selling for $95) and these compete on every level.Sound quality: Great - up there with buds going for 2x and 3x as much. They‚Äôre not as rich as some premium names but theres still a nice variety of settings to tune it to your music preferences. I found the best sound to be: Spatial Audio = off. Dynamic Sound = Dynamic Balance. EQ = Acoustic. Boom - crisp sound, heavy bass (could maybe even use a touch less but good).Features: Again, punching well above its weight. Very formidable ANC, good transparency mode, custom touch controls, low latency mode, multi-device connectivity, LDAC. Again a lot of these can‚Äôt be found on buds under $100, let alone $30. App is also simple and easy to use.Materials: Glossy buds and case similar to AirPods with the case being slightly larger.Battery life: Seems on par with what they‚Äôre advertising. We‚Äôll see how well it holds up over times but no complaints so far.Fit: Going to vary ear to ear (mine are average size I‚Äôd say) and these fit the same as AirPods to me. Nice seal even with ANC off. Probably going to be problematic for those with larger ears but that can be true with the majority of stem buds.2 cons I‚Äôd say is first the Spatial Audio is bad. Doesn‚Äôt use head tracking and the sound quality takes a hit and just becomes echoey. I can take or leave spatial so this wasn‚Äôt a big deal. The second was touched on by another reviewer but the EQ also hardly works. You can‚Äôt configure it anywhere close to the presets and there‚Äôs a huge sound discrepancy when trying to create a custom sound. Hopefully this can be fixed with an update, but as mentioned, the settings I chose fit my sound tastes well.Long story short, I got these as a cheapo backup pair with low expectations but will be recommending these to everyone, backup or daily drivers, going forward.Read more"
"Soundcore Anker Life Q20 Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Headphones, Wireless Over Ear Bluetooth Headphones, 70H Playtime, Hi-Res Audio, Deep Bass, Memory Foam Ear Cups, Travel, Office, USB-C Charging",$37.99,4.4 out of 5 stars,"2,700","TL;DR: If you‚Äôre on a tight budget and are looking for high quality headphones that are great for every use imaginable, these are for you.I‚Äôve had these headphones for almost two months now, and I cannot stress enough how shocked I am at their quality for their price.For a bit of backstory, I‚Äôm a young person who lives alone and who generally has a fairly tight budget. I‚Äôve been wanting over the ear headphones for a long time, but couldn‚Äôt reconcile the cost of the big name brands like Sony, Beats, Apple, etc. I randomly decided to do a bit of market research to see if there were any good quality options in my price range (which, I‚Äôll admit, was very limited). After a long night of reading reviews and comparing prices, I decided to go with these headphones. I thought ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre under $50, so I‚Äôm sure they won‚Äôt be amazing quality, but they should do the trick for a couple years.‚ÄùAfter using these daily for two months, I cannot explain enough how impressed I am with the quality of these budget headphones. First off, the noise settings - the active noise cancelling is genuinely impressive. It does a better job than my in-ear Bose active noise cancelling headphones, which were 4 times the price. The bass setting is my preferred setting for music listening, as I‚Äôm someone who really enjoys physically feeling music when I listen to it. I‚Äôm not an audio expert by any means, but I am someone who cares a lot about music and my listening experience, and these headphones have bested every high-priced in ear headphone I‚Äôve ever used (Apple, Bose, Beats, etc.). You don‚Äôt have to turn the volume up very much to get some good depth in this setting, which is nice. It does dampen the noise cancelling a bit, but when you‚Äôre listening to music you really can‚Äôt notice at all. The transparency setting is really useful for when I use these at work, as I can stay tuned into a meeting but still be aware of my surroundings.Physically, they‚Äôre so comfortable that I forget I‚Äôm wearing them. The foam padding is very plush and soft, and the headphones don‚Äôt feel tight on my ears at all. One slight issue is the size adjustment, at their smallest size they‚Äôre still slightly too big for me, but that‚Äôs a very small issue that I only notice when reclined/exercising. They‚Äôre very lightweight as well, I never even notice it.They also are so amazingly easy to connect to multiple devices. I have these headphones connected to my laptop, phone, and TV at any given time, and they easily switch from one to the other automatically when needed. For example, I can have my headphones on watching TV (which is great, as I live in an apartment with thin walls and I have hearing issues), and if I watch a video on my phone, they will automatically switch to my phone, then switch back to my TV when I resume my show.They‚Äôre also so pretty?? I got the pink ones, and they have a beautiful pearlescent exterior that I just love. I get compliments on it all the time!!My only issues with these headphones are so exceptionally minor that they don‚Äôt even warrant any stars off. The first is the control system - I truly cannot figure out how to skip/replay songs. I know you‚Äôre SUPPOSED to be able to do it, but no matter what arrangement I seem to press the correct button it, it doesn‚Äôt do anything but pause/play. It‚Äôs possible this is my own user error, as I threw away the user manual and haven‚Äôt looked it up, so that‚Äôs on me lol.The other slight issue I have with them is that they don‚Äôt really come with much of a carrying case. They come with a drawstring bag, which was nice until I immediately lost it because it‚Äôs significantly harder to keep track of than an actual hard-sided case. They also don‚Äôt actually offer much protection for the headphones other than from scratches, so a hard-side case would be awesome. But honestly, those complaints are so minor and irrelevant that I genuinely do not care!!All in all, I cannot recommend these enough. They are scarily good for their price, demonstrating once again that the free market is a sham and brand recognition sells more than actual product quality!!!Read more"

I own the Sony WF1000's and they are sorta the bench mark so I will try and have a balanced approach when review the Flybud 3.Sound 4 - Great mid range sound.  As much bass as I would every want and overall really good.  I have others that I prefer for audio books (but hat is because they are ""Bright"" and easy to hear voices) but like these for all general use listening.  My Sony's have a lot more detail and a broader sound stage, but without a side by side you would be hard pressed to tell the different when moving around.  I really only notice the Sony's awesomeness while sitting and concentrating on the music.  Moving around and living life in motion... I find myself grabbing the Flybuds when I am going to go work out for otherswise.Fit - These stick in you ear like an great set of earplugs.  The noise ISSOLATION is the best I have by far.  So good that in some case are quieter than my NC version of headphones where NC can actually amplifiy noise more so than cancel it... for example wind noise.  The ear wings and the ear tips are great and the most secure TWB I own by far.Battery - I have yet to every run our of battery in the case and cant recall every running out of batter in the TWBs... so batter life is great.  The ability to charge and external devise has saved me a few times.  The case is a little heavy but slick (good/bad) and slides into pockets easily.  I find it a little heavy for when I am wear light shorts or dress clothes, but would be the pair I took if I was to go on a road trip.Gripes - None really... except for the limited MultiFunction aspects of the MFB.  I would have liked to see volume added and skip back/forth be implemented in the MFB... but I have learn to live without it.FLYBUD NCFirst... I would give them a (3) start when using the stock ear-tips.  The noise isolation (vs the noise cancellation) with the stock ear-tips was terrible so I put a different set of ear-tips and that made a HUGE difference... HUGE.Fortunately Tribit acknowledges such a possibility and as a result just sent me a notice to get (3) new designed  ear-tips sent my way.  I am anxious to try them to see how they do.  In the end this is not an uncommon issue and I find that keeping old ear-tips around so as to swap them to those that work best is a good practice and something I have done with pretty much all the TWB's I own.Packaging 5:  nice as with all the Tribit products I have bought... Its nice and clean and simpleCase (4) :  Nice and small, but doesn't let you use some of the bigger ear-tips from other TWB's as the charging pins to make contact.  The case has 4 little lights on the front as the battery indicator and they seems to drop fast.  I often find it at 50% and I am thinking ""didn't i just charge that case?""... only to reflect back with the understanding that I had been using them constantly for the past couple of days... so I suspect the hours claimed are correct.... I just got use to the Flybud 3' monster 2600mah battery case and seeing those battery lights rarely fall below 75%.  lol.Earbud Battery (5) - They say 8 to 10 hrs for the earbud... that is awesome and I have no reason not to believe it.  I have yet to wear them out, but the longest I wore them was likely 3hrs to 4hrs... so your experience my vary, but for the record I have gotten ""low battery"" warnings on all my other earbuds BUT the Flybud NC's.  kudo on the battery life.Earbud Sound  (4) - Great for the price.  They are not as detailed as my Sony 1000's (they are very nice and detailed, but cost $200), but are nice in the mids with bass where you need it.  I listen to the a lot of podcast and I find the sound of the FB-NC's to be well balanced and I don't get fatigued listening over an extended period of time.  If I didn't have the Sony's to compare them I would give them a 5.  Great sound for the price.Earbud Noise Cancellation (4) - as noted WITH the different ear-tips installed the NC is really good for white noise and general background noise.  I would say it cuts down that ""sort of noise"" by 60 to 70% and works great.  Again the Sony's do it better, but without a side by side comparison you would likely not be able to tell the difference between the Tribits and the Sonys.  NC works great in office/inside environments... Very nice for car rides and plane rides and such, but not so good for outside when there is wind blowing (an issue with the Sony's as well).  The wind disrupts the ""NC"" aspects of the earbuds and can cause more noise... the good thing is you can turn it off and use them like normal TWB.  The pass-thru aspect is very nice to have and I find I use it more than I expected.  Nice feature.Some grips:- They stay in good with different ear-tips, but not very well with the stock ear-tips.- They don't have volume control and some of the other aspects of other TWB's multi-touch button, but I have learned to live with it.I find that:- I carry these FB-NC's now when I leave the house.- I carry the Flybud 3 now whenever I am going to go do anything active, especially outside where Noise Cancellation is less effective and Noise Isolation is most important... something (noise isolation) the Flybud 3's do better than any other TWB i have tried- I use my sony's when I really want to get lost in the music and isolate myself.  They are very impressive and create a detailed sound stage that none of the other TWB's I have tried can do... but again they cost 5 times as much.Hope this helps.Read more"

"Skullcandy Crusher ANC 2 Wireless Over-Ear Bluetooth Headphones with Multi-Sensory Bass and Charging Cable, Active Noise Cancelling, Up to 60 Hours Battery, Microphone for iPhone Android - True Black",$123.49,4.7 out of 5 stars,"1,863","I initially had the Crusher ANC and had been using them for about 3 years now. I realized that they weren‚Äôt picking up the 25-40hz bass range too well. I know it‚Äôs headphones, I shouldn‚Äôt expect $1000 car audio quality from headphones, I figured though, if these can get to the mid 40s range, maybe there‚Äôs some headphones out there that CAN do a little better job picking up that 25-40 range better than these (SN, I‚Äôm an audiophile and have the ears of an audio engineer, so I want my music to always sound great and these are for the gym). A lot of the music I listen to has bass in that range. So I do my research and to my surprise, Skull Candy released the ANC 2, so I did more research and found the frequency response as low as 20hz, I‚Äôm like ok, I know it‚Äôs not going to flawlessly get down to 20hz, let‚Äôs try them out though. While they don‚Äôt play below 30hz in a fantastic manner, FOR HEADPHONES UNDER $200, they catch 20-30hz about as well as they‚Äôre going to. Most of my library doesn‚Äôt get below 30hz, so I‚Äôm a happy camper. The highs and lows are so crisp and clear and the bass is even smoother on these than the ANC. It sounds like HIGH END aftermarket truck subs! If you know anything about that, truck subs have a tighter and cleaner thump to them. I‚Äôm a fan of these headphones!Read more"
"Soundcore Anker Life Q20 Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Headphones, Wireless Over Ear Bluetooth Headphones, 70H Playtime, Hi-Res Audio, Deep Bass, Memory Foam Ear Cups, Travel, Office, USB-C Charging",$37.99,4.4 out of 5 stars,"2,700","TL;DR: If you‚Äôre on a tight budget and are looking for high quality headphones that are great for every use imaginable, these are for you.I‚Äôve had these headphones for almost two months now, and I cannot stress enough how shocked I am at their quality for their price.For a bit of backstory, I‚Äôm a young person who lives alone and who generally has a fairly tight budget. I‚Äôve been wanting over the ear headphones for a long time, but couldn‚Äôt reconcile the cost of the big name brands like Sony, Beats, Apple, etc. I randomly decided to do a bit of market research to see if there were any good quality options in my price range (which, I‚Äôll admit, was very limited). After a long night of reading reviews and comparing prices, I decided to go with these headphones. I thought ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre under $50, so I‚Äôm sure they won‚Äôt be amazing quality, but they should do the trick for a couple years.‚ÄùAfter using these daily for two months, I cannot explain enough how impressed I am with the quality of these budget headphones. First off, the noise settings - the active noise cancelling is genuinely impressive. It does a better job than my in-ear Bose active noise cancelling headphones, which were 4 times the price. The bass setting is my preferred setting for music listening, as I‚Äôm someone who really enjoys physically feeling music when I listen to it. I‚Äôm not an audio expert by any means, but I am someone who cares a lot about music and my listening experience, and these headphones have bested every high-priced in ear headphone I‚Äôve ever used (Apple, Bose, Beats, etc.). You don‚Äôt have to turn the volume up very much to get some good depth in this setting, which is nice. It does dampen the noise cancelling a bit, but when you‚Äôre listening to music you really can‚Äôt notice at all. The transparency setting is really useful for when I use these at work, as I can stay tuned into a meeting but still be aware of my surroundings.Physically, they‚Äôre so comfortable that I forget I‚Äôm wearing them. The foam padding is very plush and soft, and the headphones don‚Äôt feel tight on my ears at all. One slight issue is the size adjustment, at their smallest size they‚Äôre still slightly too big for me, but that‚Äôs a very small issue that I only notice when reclined/exercising. They‚Äôre very lightweight as well, I never even notice it.They also are so amazingly easy to connect to multiple devices. I have these headphones connected to my laptop, phone, and TV at any given time, and they easily switch from one to the other automatically when needed. For example, I can have my headphones on watching TV (which is great, as I live in an apartment with thin walls and I have hearing issues), and if I watch a video on my phone, they will automatically switch to my phone, then switch back to my TV when I resume my show.They‚Äôre also so pretty?? I got the pink ones, and they have a beautiful pearlescent exterior that I just love. I get compliments on it all the time!!My only issues with these headphones are so exceptionally minor that they don‚Äôt even warrant any stars off. The first is the control system - I truly cannot figure out how to skip/replay songs. I know you‚Äôre SUPPOSED to be able to do it, but no matter what arrangement I seem to press the correct button it, it doesn‚Äôt do anything but pause/play. It‚Äôs possible this is my own user error, as I threw away the user manual and haven‚Äôt looked it up, so that‚Äôs on me lol.The other slight issue I have with them is that they don‚Äôt really come with much of a carrying case. They come with a drawstring bag, which was nice until I immediately lost it because it‚Äôs significantly harder to keep track of than an actual hard-sided case. They also don‚Äôt actually offer much protection for the headphones other than from scratches, so a hard-side case would be awesome. But honestly, those complaints are so minor and irrelevant that I genuinely do not care!!All in all, I cannot recommend these enough. They are scarily good for their price, demonstrating once again that the free market is a sham and brand recognition sells more than actual product quality!!!Read more"

"1Mii Y8+ Noise Cancelling Headphones Bluetooth, Wireless LDAC Hi-Res Audio, Custom EQ via App, 75H Playtime, Comfort Fit, Over Ear Headphones Foldable for Airplane Travel Home Office Black",$39.99,4.5 out of 5 stars,204,"I did an extensive test of seven of the highest rated wireless ANC headphones under $100 on Amazon. And I can say, these headphones punched way above their weight class! You have to love a pair that, without any app or external compensation sound so pure. They measured very well versus my Sennheiser 600HDs standard and my 7.1 entertainment room open air system. Control buttons in the right place, are just the right size, and make it a joy to use versus many others. Comfort is better than most with large circumference pads. The only negative which ended up dropping them below the higher priced #1 is the inconsistency in frequency response in ANC mode (vs normal, and my favorite setting for this pair, transparency). Yeah, when on a plane, do you really care, probably not, so at the $40 price this may be the screaming deal you can't pass up!Read more"

I've had earbuds that made my head and brain feel like they were vibrating, I'm not a fan of that feeling really, so I love that these ones don't do that but have the great bass still. I love the fact that they have a button so that just a small tap won't pause or change anything when you don't want it to. even for phone calls, YouTube videos, and tiktok these are great! mine came in with a battery charge of 100% as well, so you should be able to use them right away. the purple pair that had gotten stolen had come in with a 97% charge, too. they do come with a charger but no USB block, which I don't feel like it's an issue. I'm sure we all have a block for that laying around or we could use a desktop or laptop to charge them. the color is very pretty, too! i was expecting more of a purple tone to it since I ordered purple blue this time, but they're more blue. still gorgeous! I'm definitely going to be ordering more, though. i want the light green ones, too! I love all the different color options! and they're all such pretty colors. the purple ones were so bright, I do miss those ones! but I adore these ones for sure! the little screens in the case have never never lagged for me, either. you'll see when the charge is decreasing and it does alert you when it's low immediately. the screen on the right does show what is pictured and will let you know if they're unevenly charged, which sometimes I only use one earbud, so that's great to know septhow much of a charge they have. they're definitely worth the price and I do recommend them! packaging is safe and secure for them as well! there is a film to pull off that protects the case when you unbox it as well. and they do come with a little bag of rubber ear pieces of different sizes, which is also awesome! i believe there's 2-3 different sized ones in the little bag. soooo 10/10 definitely recommend!Read more"

"Sennheiser MOMENTUM 4 Wireless Headphones - Bluetooth Headset for Crystal-Clear Calls with Adaptive Noise Cancellation, 60h Battery Life, Lightweight Folding Design, Black",$265.95,4.0 out of 5 stars,"7,609","5 stars to me. 4 stars all around for the average consumer due to issues I believe others will find a problem with but I have found some workarounds forI will start off with the flaws (unfortunately it has em) from my experience and some solutions. They are mostly features based. I'll also address confusions and ""negative"" experiences as there are reviews where clearly it's the people and not the headphones that are the problem yet they are giving this a worse impression that it should have. And lastly praise what it has going well for itAlso, I will highly suggest downloading the new app version called smart control PLUS and install any firmware updates. Then go adjust settings or it will have some annoyances.FlawsOn-head detection: this causes most of the headaches. For those that like to free up an ear to listen to someone talk better - make a habit of freeing your left ear and not the right. There is a sensor to detect your ear and it is only INSIDE the right earcup.  It makes a double click noise when it detects and stops detecting your ear. Unfortunately it makes a similar sound for both which is a huge flaw as you might not know if it is detecting or not sometimes. This will trigger the auto off feature if it doesn't detect you while you're listening to music. It usually pauses from the headset, but there is a possibility it can be ignored by an app and continue playing so when you put it back on you might not even know if it detected you. Another possibility is you made the mistake of pressing play from the app itself when it stops detecting you thus eventually triggering the sleep feature. You can disable auto off but I personally put it in 1 hour just in case as I would have likely readjusted my headset by that point and reset it. This goes into the next feature: auto play. It's perfectly fine on mobile but on PC it can be a nightmare as you could be listening to music, you adjust your right earcup so it pauses and when you put it back on, it might play some other video like youtube in an open browser; it depends on the programs that behave to bluetooth pause/play. So don't have so many open video/audio programs in the background. Also for those with long hair, autoplay can struggle to detect if it completely covers your right ear (some people start to think it stopped working). Overall, I just disabled autoplay while keeping auto-off enabled as I mainly use the M4 on PC, but again, it seems to work really well on mobile. Plus of course if any of these aren't necessary to you, you can simply disable it as a whole for an old fashioned headphone experience to avoid annoyances but I have gotten used to it at this point that I rarely have issues [Update: I just learned on May 2025 that as of the new firmware 2.13.42 it reads ""Improved auto-off behavior reducing unexpected behavior during calls or streaming due to misdetection in smart pause sensor"", so perhaps this section might become untrue with less flaws down the road thus hopefully improving user experience]Multi- point connection: It can and will connect to two devices that have bluetooth active after they have been paired. There are individuals that pair their headphones to everything and might experience a random connection. Unfortunately no disabling this so you have to be precise with what you want to connect this with. I only paired this to PC and mobile so it doesn't attempt to connect to anything else but in the app you can click to what else in the list want to connect to (or delete). When it detects multiple signals it will prioritize connecting to what you last used, it seems. Not an issue for me. Also, it will ALWAYS prioritize audio for the first connection of the two which will usually be the phone. This is important. If it connects to my phone first, well lets say Im on the PC listening to music, once your phone makes any kind of sound, your audio will switch to it and interrupt the music, then resume playing your PC's music. Because of this, disable useless sounds like the lock screen opening sounds because that will trigger a switch (not sure about typing sounds). I have sound on for notifications to get my attention for the phone but if that is an annoyance I would try connecting other devices (like PC) as your main device first and then phone second. That way, it will ONLY play audio on the main device (PC) in spite of your phone making noises or playing audio. I tend to disable phone bluetooth, so it isn't an issue for me what connects first anyways. Now, this is a major flaw which may have been addressed in the new firmware update and app but I have not fully tested yet so this is based on months old experience. Last flaw with this. Do not have constant audio playing on -BOTH- devices because it will cause some static to what you are listening to. No idea why this happens but sometimes the music sounds glitchy and I realize it's because my PC is playing music alongside my phone. All it takes is not having something like music playing on the second device and it gets clean.Reboot: it can be done on the power button after holding for over 15 seconds. Be careful NOT to do this if it is not your intention. I have a friend who accidentally did thisHigh resolution: app is glitched if you try to do personalized sound after enabling high resolution. It will ask you to disable high resolution before proceeding. All you have to do is go to standard mode, make your sound profile, then go back and enable High Resolution.Confusions:ANC: some people complain you can't turn off ANC. You sort of can. Old app, on the ANC slide, you put the slider in the middle. Most importantly, the new version of the app now allows to turn off ANC and might possibly increase your battery life. Oh, and some people remark of ANC randomly activating when outside. That is the wind noise reduction activating during air blowing directly to your mics. You can turn it off in ANC settings (you can also adjust transparency during phone calls there) but trust me that you don't want to hear wind transmitted into a headsetAuto-answer calls: complaints on this but another reason you need the app to disable it if you don't want it.Aut-connect: some complain that if it moves it will auto connect or cause confusion when they don't know why their bluetooth loud speakers stopped working until they realize the headphones are connected. I personally love auto connect and has never been an issue. I put my headphones away where it won't move at all and once I grab it, boom, just straightforward and smooth connection grab and go. This is a feature of auto off so if you don't want it to be doing this you can either disable auto off (more like sleep) or turn off the headphones directly from the power button (which means you will also have to turn it back on with the button). I don't think of it as a flaw to be honestDiscord/meeting calls: This is a big one. There are people mentioning how when they get on discord, their music and game sounds muffled. That is its hands free activating because it believes you are in a call. It prioritizes the call once it is activating its mic. You may have noticed it on your phone before too with music getting muffled. Problem is these then get compared directly to a gaming headset. Most gaming headsets have a usb dongle. Those dongles are designed to give both high quality low latency audio and mic signals at the same time. These? They are bluetooth headsets not specifically designed for gaming but rather for high quality audio. This is not a major fault of the headset. There exists a workaround for this but you will have to disable handsfree and rely on a different mic (which can be a far superior option anyways). To do this - on windows 11, go to settings. Click ""bluetooth & devices"". Then click on ""view more devices"" up top to go to a drop down list of devices. Scroll all the way down until you find ""more devices and printer settings"". Find the M4 headset, right click and go to properties. Click on the hardware tab. On this list, look for Name ""Momentum 4 Hands-Free"" that is under Type ""Sound, Video..."". Click once on it then click on properties below. In properties, General tab, click on the blue and yellow shield that says Change Settings. Then go to the Driver tab and Click Disable Driver. Reboot PC. Can be undone in similar method. At this point it has no headset mic active ~specifically~ on the PC (phone should be unaffected) so audio will be clear but now an external mic will be needed.Experiences:Connectivity: people say they have connectivity issues but thankfully it is very rare for me. It has a good distance to it too. I keep up to date with everything on my phoneTouchpad: some say it is very sensitive. It is certainly more sensitive than usual but there are exaggerations to it. My hair does not trigger it. Turning my head does not trigger it. I don't trigger it with a hoodie on. I don't wear beanies over it (why would you?) so I cant say anything there. Stretching my arms above my head might trigger and laying my head on the right side might make it think you want to change volume or transparency. But some of these reviews are funny. They are not rated to be water resistant at all (like most headsets) so if rain drops trigger it, actually no, WHY DO YOU EVEN HAVE IT IN THE RAIN?App: the app is fine minus the glitch [refer to High Resolution in Flaws] and has only been improving bit by bit. There's now also a new version which requires a new download that will likely be getting more of a focus onDurability: it is plastic which makes it lighter but thankfully I have not broken anything. I have bumped it into things, dropped it once. I try to treat is as glass so these are rare occurrences. I would not work out in these due to the fact they are not designed to deal with liquid. If problems occur because you work out in these, well that's your fault, but there exist rubber sweat covers to put over the padding to help out a bit. The Sennheisers Momentum 4/Sport earbuds I believe have water resistance and might be worth a look instead if you need a true gym companionStrengthsAudio quality: right out of the box, they are great. It has a neutral sound profile while having some attention to bass. There are presets in the app that are decent and it really does not need a bass booster but it exists. To be honest, I would skip everything and go straight for the sound personalization feature in the app. It's very simple to adjust, uses mostly sliders while you listen to audio. And once you are done it will create a setting that somehow manages to be far superior than what's already available in the app. It just cleans up the sound so much more to your liking; the difference is bewildering. Ever since that point, I have not listened to music the same. Just when I thought I was getting bored of music, these revived that love to want to listen to everything again and also motivated me to listen to things I never did before. There is literally pre-Sennheiser and during-Sennheiser eras to me now and am curious to their wired headsets. One thing that will become super noticeable is its soundstage. It spreads the instruments to a degree where you can notice more of everything. Albeit, this can be discombobulating and bassheads might not like the lack of sharp precision but this isn't meant to be your average linear listening experience (the Accentum Plus offers this at a much lower price). To give an example: What is Life by George Harrison. I might prefer it on the more linear style I am used to but these can separate things to the point where it is also directional and you can feel like you are standing at a concert and George is directly in the middle of it all in front of you so it feels more real- similar to as if you are becoming conscious of your own breathing. And in midst of all the chaos, you can still clearly hear George's voice and you notice ALL of the instruments more. It first gave me goosebumps how much it changed the song. Some songs are designed to be ""linear"" which could possibly affect emotional type of songs negatively but from a musical perspective, my goodness it is incredible. Now I just go back to see what music I am used to that changes with these (hint: a lot). Electronic/hip-hop music perhaps is the exception but this gives such clarity to detail that it is still a great listen- one thing is for sure these headsets love when there is a band setup (Bjork, the Roots, Gorillaz, etc). Sound quality is the biggest reason you go for these.Comfort: I can go on for a while without my ears hurting or anything. Also these don't heat up much and has proper adjustability for bigger headsLook: I have the black with copper ring and they are absolutely gorgeous. I question the longevity of the cloth on the headstrap but it makes it more beautiful than it has any business being for a plastic headsetFeatures: ANC is better than I expected. It does its job, and though it might not lead in this category, the differences are so small compared to the competition. Also drowned out what I needed it to during plane trips. And hearthrough, although I have had better, they will more than suffice to the point where I rarely have any issues hearing people. The fact that it is good at both of these is amazing for value.Battery: they can go up to nearly 60 hours, especially in standard mode. Not an exaggeration. I can go days without charging them. For this quality of headset, I don't think much of the competition comes close to this. In fact this is the mind blowing part because most other bluetooth headsets don't sound anywhere as good as these and they have half the battery life if not worse. No fears when travelling that it will die on me. In fact, it lasted me an entire week's tripSurprisesGaming: it has low enough latency. Combine that with that very clean audio and surprising directional audio this already has and wow, it performs quite well. I can actually spot details better and sometimes extra details I wasn't aware like I remember distinctly many months ago when I played Paladins, not only was I able to hear behind a wall slightly above me, but I realized it was subtle high heel sounds. I am not saying this will replace top of the line gaming headsets like steel series but if you have these and not a gaming headset, these will more than suffice.Charging: I was already enamored by the battery life but the fact is, it handles charging nearly as well. You can get hours worth per 10 minutes of charging and around an hour and a half or so it will be fully charged. That may not sound great but half of that will net you 30 hours of life which is STILL more than the competition. And the other surprise was that I accidentally discovered on the PC that you can still use it while charging - it simply appears as a different sound output you have to switch to. I thought it was weird how multiple momentum 4's appeared but when I clicked the other output, music started booming through it again. I was shocked. It already has a super long battery life with quick charging. It doesn't need it yet it has it. I have never had a headset that allows that with USB-C. Sennheiser were practically showing off at this point. So I would get a super long cable to make this comfortable during charging if you think this is a feature you will be usingThese are already the greatest -bluetooth- headsets I have ever owned under the $500 mark. I have tried out direct competitors Airpods Max (best hearthrough and good clean quality) and Sony Xm5's (amazing features and stylish) but the M4 felt like a no brainer. The max have poor battery life (under 20 hours) meanwhile these can reach close to triple that. The XM5's are light and so smooth with their features and touchpad (I loved speak to chat) but their fragility comes into question as they are notorious for the hinges breaking no matter how good you take care of them while the M4's mostly have earpads wearing down (easily replaceable). Meanwhile, guess what? The M4's imo sound better than both of them, are more comfortable than both, and can be found MUCH cheaper than both as I have seen it as low as $190. Even if, say, the Bowers & Wilkins PX8 might have slightly better audio and a better build, it's not a major difference so it is imo horrifically overpriced while this just has much higher value after sales and is an easier recommendationOverall, it absolutely bothers me just how overrated the other headsets on Amazon usually are meanwhile these get a bad impression. If you are a fan of music and you want to improve that experience with the bluetooth format at great affordability, it doesn't get better than theseRead more"

These are my ultimate favorite ear plugs! Battery lasts a long time and when I put them in I don't hear anything else around me. To the point people ask me how it's possible these little ear phones can block out sound so much that I can't hear them with just one in!! I will only buy this over moving forward the others ones just weren't anywhere as good. I didn't read the directions so that part I should have done before tossing out the box. I will don't 100% know all they can do but so far so good.Read more

They are light weight.¬† They stay put.¬† I have worn them to mow and weed eat my yard, while doing laundry and a million other chores and they have not fallen off my ears.¬† The sound quality is great.¬† Could have a little more volume so can hear my music while mowing.¬† Phone usage sound is great, I have to have it a lot lower than most ear buds to hear.¬† Only time I have had any echoing is if I have my phone in my hand while trying to talk with the ear buds.¬† The directions show you can tap them to turn volume up or down and a few other commands, but I have not figured that out yet.¬† Love you can wear one at a time.¬† The holder is also a charging case.¬† Will be a great thing if we lose power this hurricane season, will be able to let the case charge them.¬† I wish they would ring with my ringtones, so I know who is calling.¬† Text tones are the same as the phone and the notification sounds.¬† Not sure why the ringtones are different.¬† Overall they are well worth the money and are very nice.Read more"

I've had earbuds that made my head and brain feel like they were vibrating, I'm not a fan of that feeling really, so I love that these ones don't do that but have the great bass still. I love the fact that they have a button so that just a small tap won't pause or change anything when you don't want it to. even for phone calls, YouTube videos, and tiktok these are great! mine came in with a battery charge of 100% as well, so you should be able to use them right away. the purple pair that had gotten stolen had come in with a 97% charge, too. they do come with a charger but no USB block, which I don't feel like it's an issue. I'm sure we all have a block for that laying around or we could use a desktop or laptop to charge them. the color is very pretty, too! i was expecting more of a purple tone to it since I ordered purple blue this time, but they're more blue. still gorgeous! I'm definitely going to be ordering more, though. i want the light green ones, too! I love all the different color options! and they're all such pretty colors. the purple ones were so bright, I do miss those ones! but I adore these ones for sure! the little screens in the case have never never lagged for me, either. you'll see when the charge is decreasing and it does alert you when it's low immediately. the screen on the right does show what is pictured and will let you know if they're unevenly charged, which sometimes I only use one earbud, so that's great to know septhow much of a charge they have. they're definitely worth the price and I do recommend them! packaging is safe and secure for them as well! there is a film to pull off that protects the case when you unbox it as well. and they do come with a little bag of rubber ear pieces of different sizes, which is also awesome! i believe there's 2-3 different sized ones in the little bag. soooo 10/10 definitely recommend!Read more"

Wireless Earbuds Bluetooth 5.3 Headphones 50H Playtime Deep Bass Stereo Ear Buds with Mic IPX7 Waterproof Comfort Lightweight in Ear Earphones for Pad Android/iOS Phones Gifts for Women Men,$11.39,4.3 out of 5 stars,"1,307","The media could not be loaded.I have a very loud job running heavy equipment and need noise cancelling and high quality audio and sound to enjoy music at all while i work.  In the last few years i have purchased 6 different earbuds from 6 different companies from the 15 dollar range all the way up to a set from sony with so many features that the 180 dollar price tag seemed reasonable.  In reality there was a set that cost 85 bucks that had been my number one choice due to everything from comfort and fit and functionality, and had seemingly no competitors.  Then i got this set.  To be fair there were some neat features on the super expensive sony pair and a couple unique to the best so far, a set of JLab executive earbuds.  Now ive been using this set of earbuds from Twosky for just short of a week, and man I am stunned by what you get for 17.99 from these guys!  First off, the case (when fully charged) can recharge the buds themselves 4 times meaning up to 50 freaking hours on a single case charge and thats just spectacular.  Second, this set came with the new thing of having a usable display and touch controls on its screen showing time, connectivity and battery charge.  There are also touch/pinch controls on the buds themselves so all basic functions can be operated without getting out your phone, such as play/pause, skip forward and back in the playlist and so on.  While it would have been nice to have more than just the basic small, medium, large for the earplug size the provided sizes should be fine for 99% of people.  Connection has shown to be stable up to 45 feet away for me and there is a ton of interference in my crowded apartment complex.  As for the price, i may have mentioned that there were a couple neat features on the VASTLY more expensiveJLab executive set, and the same for the sony set, but for the price of the Sony set you could get 2 of these for youself (the Sony and JLab both lack a touchscreen case and have less than half the battery time even on a full earbuds case charge) and buy 8 more to give out as gifts and the sound is 1000% better with these.  They are comfortable to wear for hours at a time so far.  I havent had chance to see if they are sturdy as i try not to drop or damage em.  Having said this i wish i had more money because im sure the higher end twosky stuff must be fantastic.  Best value headphones in 10 years.  Crushes Beats by Dre imho.  EDIT: I had totally forgotten. About the neat extra function of having a camera button!  Using the case as a remote for taking pics is super useful since you can set your phone up and get everything set for a picture and not have to use a timer or a voice control, just tap a button on the case and take as many pics as you want.  Super neat function.  EDIT #2:  Well it finally happened and i dropped one of these.  Its a real test when i drop an earbud, as i am 6 foot 5.  One drop for the jlab executive killed it instantly.  The sony buds clocking in at 180 bucks a pair with no features and weak sound compared to the Twosky?  One bud now sounds like its inside a tin pail when its doing anything but the weakest speaking voice.  Twosky?  Bounced twice, and it was clacking so i know it landed hard and not on just the ear cushion as you would hope and pray for.  Picked it up from the concrete that had similarly destroyed 250 bucks worth of high end ear buds (being tall has real drawbacks people) and just hoped it still made sound, although i paid 17.99 so replacement would be way less painful i said out loud to myself.  Popped it back in with no hope and it played just like new.  Seriously man I'm ready to take a spokesman job for Twosky at this point.  Gettin these for everyone who uses earbuds for their next gift.  If you guys have anything in the higher end Twosky, let me test em and if they can really improve on these I will be buying em, and you will have a lifelong customer!  Just keep the quality at this level or better cause its fantastic folks.  Seriously.Read more"

MIDOLA Bluetooth Headphones Over Ear 68H Playtime 6 EQ Wireless Headset with Microphone HiFi Stereo Foldable Lightweight Deep Bass for Travel Home Office Cellphone Red,$15.99,4.5 out of 5 stars,791,"First off, do not let the price fool you! I have had other high end headphones, and these may not be top tier but they do contend with them. The sound quality I found depends on the device its connected to. I have a top of the line samsung, and they sound amazing paired with it. I also have a gov issued phone which is absolute garbage, and these still sound pretty good on it. Pairing was easy, scanned and paired right away. I am all about noise cancelling and these are pretty good for that, I played with the EQ button, and found punk to be the most effective. It had the most bass, even more so than the bass setting. No sound quality lost on either device. I also liked that it can be wired using no battery, however you can not use any of the buttons on the headset. I did not check battery after 3 hours of continuous use but honestly I dont need more then that. the fit is really good, they dont feel heavy on my head, cover my ears very well. Bright red so my family can see that I am tuning out the world. Very good buy, for me.Read more"
"Apple AirPods Wireless Ear Buds, Bluetooth Headphones with Lightning Charging Case Included, Over 24 Hours of Battery Life, Effortless Setup for iPhone",,4.7 out of 5 stars,"633,714","Taking the Apple AirPods at face value, they're a solid headset for the money! If you already have the original, first generation AirPods and just want to upgrade, not a bad option either. The 2nd generation AirPods feature an improved software chip & runs off of BlueTooth 5.0 vs 4.1 (Gen 1). The software chip allows a faster, stronger, and more stable connection with your device(s). This particular item for $139.00 does NOT feature the wireless charging case. This one must be plugged in via USB (cable provided in the box) to an outlet or USB port. The wireless charging case model is $169. Now if you're looking to upgrade to the wireless charging case later on, you can. Apple does sell it separately. If you want the wireless charging option right out of the box, I recommend sending the $169 vs the $139 product here.Sound quality: Straight out of the box, sound is pretty solid. No crackles, static, pops, or any abnormal noises created by the more economic-friendly headsets. You have a lot more adjustability & tuning capabilities if paired on an iOS/Apple device vs using for example paired with an Android OS device. So, ultimately Apple users may or may not get a better sound quality experience.Noise cancellation: AirPods do fit fairly well in the ear without having to be jammed inside your ear canal. Generally they create a snug fit using Apple's ""universal"" earphone design, it is one size fits most not one size fits all. Some users have upgraded or opted to spend the additional funds on a set of AirPods Pro due to the rubber tips for a better/snug fit. I believe only the AirPods Pro currently has an active noise cancellation utilizing two microphones but I would double-check Apple for accurate information. Also, for Android users. The Galaxy buds by Samsung feature active noise cancellation & wireless charging case on every model so you might want to look into that product before making a final purchase.Battery life: For optimal battery life, I highly recommend charging both AirPods inside the case. The case itself is a battery pack with a life. So if one or both AirPods are low on battery, you can toss them in the case and charge them up. Apple I believe rates 5 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 1 hour of talk/listening time and 15 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 2 hours of talk/listening. I'm sure this is accurate when they're brand new but I'm sure like anything, normal ware & tare might diminish that over time.Warranty: Apple provides a 1-year standard manufacturer's warranty on this product. This ONLY covers defects/defaults from the manufacturer. This will NOT cover physical and/or liquid damages to AirPods, case, or charging cable included.AppleCare: It's $29.00 and 2 years and well worth the extra money. You're already spending this kind of money on a headset, may as well have protection. We get it, accidents happen! But protect yourself and get your AirPods repaired/replaced at no additional cost to YOU! There is no additional fees or deductibles involved.AppleCare tips:You don't have to install AppleCare right away. You have 60 days from the original purchase date to contact Apple by providing your AirPods serial number (on outside of the box) and Apple will tell you if you're still eligible.You can renew AppleCare for another 2 years for the same fee of $29.00 provided you want to keep the same product. If you decide to upgrade to the AirPods Pro or whatever the latest model is, you would have to purchase AppleCare for that specific product.You can go into an Apple store location and get live repair/replacement on your AirPods.Using AirPods with Android:Apple has allowed Android and other non-iOS devices to use AirPods since the AirPods pair/connect via BlueTooth.If you're using AirPods on an Android platform such as Samsung or LG for example there's 2 ways to pair the headset to your device. You either turn on BlueTooth on your device, pop both AirPods inside your ear, find ""AirPods"" under available connections, and connect. Or you might have to pair manually using the button on the AirPods case to make available, pair, and connect.FAIR WARNING:You will NOT have access to all features that the AirPods have to offer on an Apple/iOS device. You will be limited on functions you can perform.I was able to find an app on Google play store for $1.99 called ""AirPopUp"". It is a paid application that unlock access to certain/more features of the AirPods similar to what an Apple/iOS device would be granted. Be aware that you will NOT have access nor the ability to have every single feature since you're not on Apple's network. There may be other apps (most likely paid applications) you'd have to find that may unlock more features such as: AirPods battery life percentage, case battery life percentage, programming LEFT & RIGHT AirPods for certain function(s), skipping/pausing/resetting songs, answer/decline/hang up phone calls, find my AirPods, and more.For Samsung users specifically, you might want to look into the Galaxy Buds. They're a little cheaper than AirPods, I believe Amazon has them for $109.99 + $22 3-Year insurance through Assurion that does cover physical/liquid/accidental damage just like AirPods.Galaxy Buds features:Made by SamsungAudio powered by AKGRubber ear bud tipsPair with Samsung device to get the mostWireless charging caseActive noise cancellationComes in multiple colors (black/white/silver/yellow/red & black combo with Star Wars edition Galaxy Note 10+)Includes changing cord and replacement rubber earbud tips.I know if you pair the Galaxy Buds with a Samsung device it will automatically download an application titled ""Galaxy Wearable"". This allows users to check battery life status of the case and each bud, prompts you for software updates, ability to program LEFT & RIGHT earbuds to do certain function(s), answer/decline/hang up phone calls, pause/skip/reset songs.Apple may charge a lot of money for their products on accessories but they never fall short of being a revolutionary, well-designed, reliable product that works as advertised.Read more"
Open Ear Earbuds Lightweight Comfort Clip Wireless Earbuds Sweat Resistant Bluetooth Headphones Sport Headphones for Workouts and Running with Dual Digital Display 44H Playtime IPX7 Waterproof,$9.99,4.4 out of 5 stars,850,"These ear-clip phones are incredible.  Fantastic comfort, surprisingly great audio quality (even on bass reproduction!), and super easy user experience from the initial pairing to intuitive touch button-tap system.  Took a little bit of time, maybe 10 minutes out of the box, to figure out the volume adjustments, and how to determine what the charging indicators were displaying. I hesitate to say this, maybe from brand self-shaming, but my Bose Open Earphones (similar technology for audio where the drivers are outside the ear canal) are neck and neck with these.  But those cost $300 new.I've now bought 3 pairs of these so my wife can have some between her work laptop and here at home surfing Netflix on the iPad.  She loves the unobtrusive design and comfort away from her glasses, unlike just about every other ""over the ear"" form factor out there.  She was also hilariously awestruck when first listening to music; she couldn't believe that my son and I couldn't hear what she was playing.  Also, the reproduction quality of the tune she played was so good, that she felt like the reverb on the recording was coming from inside the house!If you get anything from this review, just know I'm a sound designer by trade, so my hearing is literally the most important thing for me to protect - and open earphones are the best way to do so, outside of maybe bone conduction.  These are some of the best I've ever used.  Get them.  Your eardrums and cartilage will thank you!Read more"

These are easy to drop‚Ä¶so that‚Äôs important to be able to identify them quickly when they fall on the floor.Also they are so ugly that no one will want to steal them.  They are perfect for me for this reason .So ugly that they are cute!  Like a bulldog haha.Works very well!!  Only thing is‚Ä¶the commands are really hard to learn. Like if you want to raise the volume you gotta stroke the earbud in just the right spot and the right way ‚Äî or it performs a different function.  That‚Äôs annoying.  But whatever ‚Äî I can just control the music and skip songs / raise  and lower the volume with my phone instead of using the earbud touch commands.  No big deal.  I‚Äôm just saying, if you‚Äôre like a millimeter off performing the swipe, it won‚Äôt do what you want it to do which is frustrating.But other than that, these are fantastic.  They fit in my ear well, they are very comfortable to wear for long periods of time.  They hold their charge for days.  I have yet to even charge them‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs been like 3 weeks.  I use them daily for 8-10 hours. So that‚Äôs like 400+ hours so far on a factory charge.I really like that the case charges the earbuds when you put them back in there. And it‚Äôs magnetic, so you just get kinda close and drop them ‚Äî they fall right into the correct charging position.  No need in trying to get them just right position wise ‚Äî they position themselves.  That magnet is really convenient.Five stars!!  I‚Äôd recommend these to everyone.  Seriously this is the best $18 I have ever spent on headphones.  I foresee these lasting years. I like that they are branded with cereal logo too. It makes for good conversation starters cuz when you pull them out, people always ask about them.I bought a C Charger Power Bank too with the Haribo Gummy Bears üêª logo.  So that‚Äôs kinda neat that gummy bears charges my fruity pebbles headphones haha.I‚Äôm so glad I bought these!!Recommend them to kids and adults.Also great sound quality!

"PHILIPS H6509 Wireless Headphones,Over-Ear Bluetooth Headphones with Noise Canceling Pro,Dynamic Bass,70H Battery Life,Fast Charging,Soft Ear Cups,Bluetooth 5.3, Multipoint Connectivity,App Control",$49.99,4.2 out of 5 stars,856,"First off, it's important to note that these headphones fill a niche: somebody who wants an over-ear style closed-back headset that has some degree of water/dust resistance (in this case, IP55). They probably shouldn't be the only pair of headphones you own and use. These are ideal for exercise (since they can handle sweat) or anywhere they might get hit with drops of rain or sand. You can even use them in the bathtub without worry of splashing on them (unlike most other over-ear sets), but be very careful not to submerge or drop them in the water.If you don't need the water resistance, you can find better audio quality and comfort. For home listening, I'd suggest springing a bit more for a comfortable open-back headset set, and for casual listening outside the house, high quality earbuds (which I'd also suggest springing a bit more for) are still ideal. However, my problem with earbuds is that when exercising, my ear canals tend to tighten up and they become extremely uncomfortable. This set is built to stay on your head while exercising, so it can feel a bit tight after a couple hours, but the earpads have a soft ""cooling gel"" that is better than other sets I've used, and it definitely gets more comfortable after a short break-in period. As an added bonus, the pads are removable and the outer lining is washable (although they feel pretty durable, I'm curious to see how long they last). The headband has a strip of rubber to soften the pressure, but it does feel a bit too hard and some comfort improvements could be made there. On the other hand, it feels built like a tank - they're light on your head, but still feel extremely durable. Other bonuses include a standard audio jack as an option instead of Bluetooth, big sturdy volume control buttons that aren't a pain to use like most headset controls, and an insane battery that lasts ages (I got at least the manufacturer spec of 35 hours, using them 2-3 hours a day for nearly two weeks without needing to recharge).These weren't the first pair of water-resistant cans I bought from Phillips. The previous version was the SH402, which I bought based on goodwill coming from their excellent X2 headphones I've used for years. These were an absolute travesty, with buzzing out of one side and audio quality that sounded like somebody playing music under a couch in the next room with the door closed, and I'd never returned something so fast. The A4216 set VASTLY improves on these, with very good audio quality. It's still not top-tier in the pure audio department or anything - it's a bit overly bassy with a hint of a muffled quality in the way a lot of closed-back headsets that are built to prevent audio leakage are - but it's more than good enough as a minor compromise to balance out the other benefits this set has (especially for the reasonable price), and again, if you don't need an exercise/water-resistant headset, you'd probably want to look elsewhere anyway. If you happen to be in that particular market though, I'm not sure you can really do much better than these.Read more"

I've had earbuds that made my head and brain feel like they were vibrating, I'm not a fan of that feeling really, so I love that these ones don't do that but have the great bass still. I love the fact that they have a button so that just a small tap won't pause or change anything when you don't want it to. even for phone calls, YouTube videos, and tiktok these are great! mine came in with a battery charge of 100% as well, so you should be able to use them right away. the purple pair that had gotten stolen had come in with a 97% charge, too. they do come with a charger but no USB block, which I don't feel like it's an issue. I'm sure we all have a block for that laying around or we could use a desktop or laptop to charge them. the color is very pretty, too! i was expecting more of a purple tone to it since I ordered purple blue this time, but they're more blue. still gorgeous! I'm definitely going to be ordering more, though. i want the light green ones, too! I love all the different color options! and they're all such pretty colors. the purple ones were so bright, I do miss those ones! but I adore these ones for sure! the little screens in the case have never never lagged for me, either. you'll see when the charge is decreasing and it does alert you when it's low immediately. the screen on the right does show what is pictured and will let you know if they're unevenly charged, which sometimes I only use one earbud, so that's great to know septhow much of a charge they have. they're definitely worth the price and I do recommend them! packaging is safe and secure for them as well! there is a film to pull off that protects the case when you unbox it as well. and they do come with a little bag of rubber ear pieces of different sizes, which is also awesome! i believe there's 2-3 different sized ones in the little bag. soooo 10/10 definitely recommend!Read more"

I use them every day, and they‚Äôve become such a coveted item that my son tries to take mine, so I got him a pair. His is blue and mine is black and gold. He already had his headphones, and when mine showed up, a little tug-of-war ensued, but I won.The headphones paired easily with my cell phone, laptop, and television. While I only use one device at a time (not multiple connections), the pairing process was quick and seamless. When paired with my TV, the connection has always been stable‚Äîunless I walk out of range. For example, if I‚Äôm watching TV in the living room and then walk to the garage, the sound may become spotty due to the number of walls in between.

For the price I paid, these headphones are worth it.I‚Äôve purchased this brand a few times before because of its solid balance of quality and affordability.

Nonetheless the sound quality is amazing with tooooons of bass. These are advertised as over the ear but are kind of over, kind of on. I can't stand the sound and feeling of on ear headphones but these feel really good actually. The EQ settings are pretty useless. One is clear with great bass, the other has a lot of mid, and the other is just flat. Skip em and keep it on ""voice"" setting. Comes with a 3.5mm cable and USB-C charging cable. The color is ok, kind of yellow, kind of pinkish. A little bulky out of the corner of my eye. The fold up really nicely. Not sure if it's worth $160+ but a good starting point if you like a lot of bass. But for the price I would like some actual ANC.

The sound is crisp and amazing bass, and makes music sound the way it was made.However, for Amazon customer service 1 star!  Placed the order for the spring deal along with other items all in which were being delivered together in the same shipping box. However, when the shipment arrived all items were included except they forgot to box the ear buds. Called to let them know about the missing item in which they told me they would have to investigate and that process could take up to 5 days. So no refund or no replacement I would have to re-order the ear buds in which I did and am I glad I did. NOW, for Amazon you guys really need to improve your service in regards to handling matters such as mine. First, the investigation I'm fine with and understand perfectly it needs to get done to prevent fraud from consumers. Talking with the first person when I called I wanted to make sure about the investigation process being done because it was a simple one at that. All that had to be done was see the time that the delivery label was printed shortly before that time you would clearly be able to see the person packing my items, and see only 3 out of the 4 items were placed in the box. Case closed! I do not appreciate having to call to check on the status and everything agents were rude and could not answer simple questions I still had about the investigation process. Now, after 4 days I called again to see the status of the investigation, for the operator to say we are issuing a refund. Why, did I not get a phone call or email letting me know about the result. Why is it me having to take time out of my day again to find out the status for a mistake your company clearly did while shipping my items. All, I was asking for is basic customer service admitting you were wrong and the very least an apology. I do not appreciate having to waste my time after not receiving an item I purchased having to go through this type of treatment. I really do not appreciate as if I was wrong and trying to commit fraud making a false claim. If this is the type of service that is consistently given, I will in the future spend more money and give my business to a company that shows appreciation.Read more"

The device is straightforward to pair and works seamlessly, particularly suitable for call centers and busy households. Customers praise its battery life, with one noting up to 20+ hours of talk time on a single charge, and appreciate its wireless range and lightweight design.Aesthetics - The headset features a contemporary and elegant design, characterized by a sleek jet-black exterior. Polished chrome and satin-metal accents are tastefully incorporated into the headphone casing and microphone boom, conveying a refined aesthetic that is subtle yet sophisticated. When not in use, the headset is designed to rest on its minimalist charging stand, which includes an elegant horizontal LED indicator to display the headset's power and charging status.Comfort - The headset is designed for extended comfort, featuring a lightweight construction with plush padding at all contact points.

The fit is secure and gentle, making it ideal for prolonged use.Sound quality - The headset incorporates a driver capable of reproducing an expansive frequency range. Music is rendered with sparkling highs, clear vocals, and a deep, tight, and punchy bass. While the sound quality is more than sufficient for office use, designed with work environments in mind, the active noise cancellation ensures voice clarity by minimizing ambient distractions.I recently discovered it can be connected to two devices at once which is dangerous information. I can have it connected to both my work computer as well as my phone. I watch shows on my phone, and when a call comes in it automatically pauses the show. When the call ends the show plays again. It does have decent range (I can wander to the next room over to grab something or put away laundry between calls). The only downside is it's a little too tight. I have 5 piercings in each ear and the headphones can press the backs of the earrings into my head. If I tilt the headphones forward so there is less pressure on my ears, it means the microphone is poking me in the face. I have to bend the microphone backwards so it sticks out further from my face. The body is very round which looks comical; it sits about 2 inches away from the top of my head, making them look bulkier than they are. But no one sees me so it doesn't really matter. Many of my colleagues in the office have similar headsets and they report they can interfere with each otherheadset a few weeks ago and I have really enjoyed using it. I knew this product was going to be great when they arrived. The packaging was high quality, awesome, and looked great.

"Sennheiser MOMENTUM 4 Wireless Headphones - Bluetooth Headset for Crystal-Clear Calls with Adaptive Noise Cancellation, 60h Battery Life, Lightweight Folding Design, Black",$265.95,4.0 out of 5 stars,"7,609","5 stars to me. 4 stars all around for the average consumer due to issues I believe others will find a problem with but I have found some workarounds forI will start off with the flaws (unfortunately it has em) from my experience and some solutions. They are mostly features based. I'll also address confusions and ""negative"" experiences as there are reviews where clearly it's the people and not the headphones that are the problem yet they are giving this a worse impression that it should have. And lastly praise what it has going well for itAlso, I will highly suggest downloading the new app version called smart control PLUS and install any firmware updates. Then go adjust settings or it will have some annoyances.FlawsOn-head detection: this causes most of the headaches. For those that like to free up an ear to listen to someone talk better - make a habit of freeing your left ear and not the right. There is a sensor to detect your ear and it is only INSIDE the right earcup.  It makes a double click noise when it detects and stops detecting your ear. Unfortunately it makes a similar sound for both which is a huge flaw as you might not know if it is detecting or not sometimes. This will trigger the auto off feature if it doesn't detect you while you're listening to music. It usually pauses from the headset, but there is a possibility it can be ignored by an app and continue playing so when you put it back on you might not even know if it detected you. Another possibility is you made the mistake of pressing play from the app itself when it stops detecting you thus eventually triggering the sleep feature. You can disable auto off but I personally put it in 1 hour just in case as I would have likely readjusted my headset by that point and reset it. This goes into the next feature: auto play. It's perfectly fine on mobile but on PC it can be a nightmare as you could be listening to music, you adjust your right earcup so it pauses and when you put it back on, it might play some other video like youtube in an open browser; it depends on the programs that behave to bluetooth pause/play. So don't have so many open video/audio programs in the background. Also for those with long hair, autoplay can struggle to detect if it completely covers your right ear (some people start to think it stopped working). Overall, I just disabled autoplay while keeping auto-off enabled as I mainly use the M4 on PC, but again, it seems to work really well on mobile. Plus of course if any of these aren't necessary to you, you can simply disable it as a whole for an old fashioned headphone experience to avoid annoyances but I have gotten used to it at this point that I rarely have issues [Update: I just learned on May 2025 that as of the new firmware 2.13.42 it reads ""Improved auto-off behavior reducing unexpected behavior during calls or streaming due to misdetection in smart pause sensor"", so perhaps this section might become untrue with less flaws down the road thus hopefully improving user experience]Multi- point connection: It can and will connect to two devices that have bluetooth active after they have been paired. There are individuals that pair their headphones to everything and might experience a random connection. Unfortunately no disabling this so you have to be precise with what you want to connect this with. I only paired this to PC and mobile so it doesn't attempt to connect to anything else but in the app you can click to what else in the list want to connect to (or delete). When it detects multiple signals it will prioritize connecting to what you last used, it seems. Not an issue for me. Also, it will ALWAYS prioritize audio for the first connection of the two which will usually be the phone. This is important. If it connects to my phone first, well lets say Im on the PC listening to music, once your phone makes any kind of sound, your audio will switch to it and interrupt the music, then resume playing your PC's music. Because of this, disable useless sounds like the lock screen opening sounds because that will trigger a switch (not sure about typing sounds). I have sound on for notifications to get my attention for the phone but if that is an annoyance I would try connecting other devices (like PC) as your main device first and then phone second. That way, it will ONLY play audio on the main device (PC) in spite of your phone making noises or playing audio. I tend to disable phone bluetooth, so it isn't an issue for me what connects first anyways. Now, this is a major flaw which may have been addressed in the new firmware update and app but I have not fully tested yet so this is based on months old experience. Last flaw with this. Do not have constant audio playing on -BOTH- devices because it will cause some static to what you are listening to. No idea why this happens but sometimes the music sounds glitchy and I realize it's because my PC is playing music alongside my phone. All it takes is not having something like music playing on the second device and it gets clean.Reboot: it can be done on the power button after holding for over 15 seconds. Be careful NOT to do this if it is not your intention. I have a friend who accidentally did thisHigh resolution: app is glitched if you try to do personalized sound after enabling high resolution. It will ask you to disable high resolution before proceeding. All you have to do is go to standard mode, make your sound profile, then go back and enable High Resolution.Confusions:ANC: some people complain you can't turn off ANC. You sort of can. Old app, on the ANC slide, you put the slider in the middle. Most importantly, the new version of the app now allows to turn off ANC and might possibly increase your battery life. Oh, and some people remark of ANC randomly activating when outside. That is the wind noise reduction activating during air blowing directly to your mics. You can turn it off in ANC settings (you can also adjust transparency during phone calls there) but trust me that you don't want to hear wind transmitted into a headsetAuto-answer calls: complaints on this but another reason you need the app to disable it if you don't want it.Aut-connect: some complain that if it moves it will auto connect or cause confusion when they don't know why their bluetooth loud speakers stopped working until they realize the headphones are connected. I personally love auto connect and has never been an issue. I put my headphones away where it won't move at all and once I grab it, boom, just straightforward and smooth connection grab and go. This is a feature of auto off so if you don't want it to be doing this you can either disable auto off (more like sleep) or turn off the headphones directly from the power button (which means you will also have to turn it back on with the button). I don't think of it as a flaw to be honestDiscord/meeting calls: This is a big one. There are people mentioning how when they get on discord, their music and game sounds muffled. That is its hands free activating because it believes you are in a call. It prioritizes the call once it is activating its mic. You may have noticed it on your phone before too with music getting muffled. Problem is these then get compared directly to a gaming headset. Most gaming headsets have a usb dongle. Those dongles are designed to give both high quality low latency audio and mic signals at the same time. These? They are bluetooth headsets not specifically designed for gaming but rather for high quality audio. This is not a major fault of the headset. There exists a workaround for this but you will have to disable handsfree and rely on a different mic (which can be a far superior option anyways). To do this - on windows 11, go to settings. Click ""bluetooth & devices"". Then click on ""view more devices"" up top to go to a drop down list of devices. Scroll all the way down until you find ""more devices and printer settings"". Find the M4 headset, right click and go to properties. Click on the hardware tab. On this list, look for Name ""Momentum 4 Hands-Free"" that is under Type ""Sound, Video..."". Click once on it then click on properties below. In properties, General tab, click on the blue and yellow shield that says Change Settings. Then go to the Driver tab and Click Disable Driver. Reboot PC. Can be undone in similar method. At this point it has no headset mic active ~specifically~ on the PC (phone should be unaffected) so audio will be clear but now an external mic will be needed.Experiences:Connectivity: people say they have connectivity issues but thankfully it is very rare for me. It has a good distance to it too. I keep up to date with everything on my phoneTouchpad: some say it is very sensitive. It is certainly more sensitive than usual but there are exaggerations to it. My hair does not trigger it. Turning my head does not trigger it. I don't trigger it with a hoodie on. I don't wear beanies over it (why would you?) so I cant say anything there. Stretching my arms above my head might trigger and laying my head on the right side might make it think you want to change volume or transparency. But some of these reviews are funny. They are not rated to be water resistant at all (like most headsets) so if rain drops trigger it, actually no, WHY DO YOU EVEN HAVE IT IN THE RAIN?App: the app is fine minus the glitch [refer to High Resolution in Flaws] and has only been improving bit by bit. There's now also a new version which requires a new download that will likely be getting more of a focus onDurability: it is plastic which makes it lighter but thankfully I have not broken anything. I have bumped it into things, dropped it once. I try to treat is as glass so these are rare occurrences. I would not work out in these due to the fact they are not designed to deal with liquid. If problems occur because you work out in these, well that's your fault, but there exist rubber sweat covers to put over the padding to help out a bit. The Sennheisers Momentum 4/Sport earbuds I believe have water resistance and might be worth a look instead if you need a true gym companionStrengthsAudio quality: right out of the box, they are great. It has a neutral sound profile while having some attention to bass. There are presets in the app that are decent and it really does not need a bass booster but it exists. To be honest, I would skip everything and go straight for the sound personalization feature in the app. It's very simple to adjust, uses mostly sliders while you listen to audio. And once you are done it will create a setting that somehow manages to be far superior than what's already available in the app. It just cleans up the sound so much more to your liking; the difference is bewildering. Ever since that point, I have not listened to music the same. Just when I thought I was getting bored of music, these revived that love to want to listen to everything again and also motivated me to listen to things I never did before. There is literally pre-Sennheiser and during-Sennheiser eras to me now and am curious to their wired headsets. One thing that will become super noticeable is its soundstage. It spreads the instruments to a degree where you can notice more of everything. Albeit, this can be discombobulating and bassheads might not like the lack of sharp precision but this isn't meant to be your average linear listening experience (the Accentum Plus offers this at a much lower price). To give an example: What is Life by George Harrison. I might prefer it on the more linear style I am used to but these can separate things to the point where it is also directional and you can feel like you are standing at a concert and George is directly in the middle of it all in front of you so it feels more real- similar to as if you are becoming conscious of your own breathing. And in midst of all the chaos, you can still clearly hear George's voice and you notice ALL of the instruments more. It first gave me goosebumps how much it changed the song. Some songs are designed to be ""linear"" which could possibly affect emotional type of songs negatively but from a musical perspective, my goodness it is incredible. Now I just go back to see what music I am used to that changes with these (hint: a lot). Electronic/hip-hop music perhaps is the exception but this gives such clarity to detail that it is still a great listen- one thing is for sure these headsets love when there is a band setup (Bjork, the Roots, Gorillaz, etc). Sound quality is the biggest reason you go for these.Comfort: I can go on for a while without my ears hurting or anything. Also these don't heat up much and has proper adjustability for bigger headsLook: I have the black with copper ring and they are absolutely gorgeous. I question the longevity of the cloth on the headstrap but it makes it more beautiful than it has any business being for a plastic headsetFeatures: ANC is better than I expected. It does its job, and though it might not lead in this category, the differences are so small compared to the competition. Also drowned out what I needed it to during plane trips. And hearthrough, although I have had better, they will more than suffice to the point where I rarely have any issues hearing people. The fact that it is good at both of these is amazing for value.Battery: they can go up to nearly 60 hours, especially in standard mode. Not an exaggeration. I can go days without charging them. For this quality of headset, I don't think much of the competition comes close to this. In fact this is the mind blowing part because most other bluetooth headsets don't sound anywhere as good as these and they have half the battery life if not worse. No fears when travelling that it will die on me. In fact, it lasted me an entire week's tripSurprisesGaming: it has low enough latency. Combine that with that very clean audio and surprising directional audio this already has and wow, it performs quite well. I can actually spot details better and sometimes extra details I wasn't aware like I remember distinctly many months ago when I played Paladins, not only was I able to hear behind a wall slightly above me, but I realized it was subtle high heel sounds. I am not saying this will replace top of the line gaming headsets like steel series but if you have these and not a gaming headset, these will more than suffice.Charging: I was already enamored by the battery life but the fact is, it handles charging nearly as well. You can get hours worth per 10 minutes of charging and around an hour and a half or so it will be fully charged. That may not sound great but half of that will net you 30 hours of life which is STILL more than the competition. And the other surprise was that I accidentally discovered on the PC that you can still use it while charging - it simply appears as a different sound output you have to switch to. I thought it was weird how multiple momentum 4's appeared but when I clicked the other output, music started booming through it again. I was shocked. It already has a super long battery life with quick charging. It doesn't need it yet it has it. I have never had a headset that allows that with USB-C. Sennheiser were practically showing off at this point. So I would get a super long cable to make this comfortable during charging if you think this is a feature you will be usingThese are already the greatest -bluetooth- headsets I have ever owned under the $500 mark. I have tried out direct competitors Airpods Max (best hearthrough and good clean quality) and Sony Xm5's (amazing features and stylish) but the M4 felt like a no brainer. The max have poor battery life (under 20 hours) meanwhile these can reach close to triple that. The XM5's are light and so smooth with their features and touchpad (I loved speak to chat) but their fragility comes into question as they are notorious for the hinges breaking no matter how good you take care of them while the M4's mostly have earpads wearing down (easily replaceable). Meanwhile, guess what? The M4's imo sound better than both of them, are more comfortable than both, and can be found MUCH cheaper than both as I have seen it as low as $190. Even if, say, the Bowers & Wilkins PX8 might have slightly better audio and a better build, it's not a major difference so it is imo horrifically overpriced while this just has much higher value after sales and is an easier recommendationOverall, it absolutely bothers me just how overrated the other headsets on Amazon usually are meanwhile these get a bad impression. If you are a fan of music and you want to improve that experience with the bluetooth format at great affordability, it doesn't get better than theseRead more"
"Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S2e Over-Ear Headphones - Enhanced Noise Cancellation & Transparency Mode, Crystal-Clear Calls, Bluetooth, 30-Hour Playback, Cloud Grey",$349.00,4.4 out of 5 stars,"1,305","After my first generation AirPods Pro developed faulty ANC in the left ear, and after I found there were no ear tips that worked for my ears, and after several complaints from people calling me while I used them, I was back on the market for some wireless headphones. Preferably over ear to reduce slippage, and preferably ANC for work use to reduce distractions in office and kids at home.After reading RTINGS, CNET, What Hi~Fi?, and other press outlets, I was continually bombarded with Sony XM4, XM5, and Bose QuietComfort, QuietComfort Ultra as the ones to beat. My sister has the XM4s, and I picked up Bose offerings since I‚Äôve already purchased audio previously from them. I‚Äôve written reviews of both of those products as well if you‚Äôre curious. TLDR: The QC 2023s are excellent and a more practical headphone than the Ultras, but the Ultras sound slightly better. My concern with both products from Bose was their build quality. Both of them are made of lightweight, somewhat flimsy plastic. The reason for this is of course to keep both weight and clamping force down. It‚Äôs what makes the ‚Äúcomfort‚Äù portion of the QuietComfort moniker. But nonetheless, I have small kids and the (retail price) of both are $350-$430. Especially at the $430 mark, there needs to be some premium materials used.Enter Bowers & Wilkins with their Px7 S2e. I have been led to believe that these compete at the premium price point with Bose and Sony but deliver superior sound and build quality to both. At $399, they slot just between the QuietComfort ($349) and QuietComfort Ultra ($429) in price. Though I will not compare to these, Sony's XM4 ($349) and XM5 ($399) retail as similarly priced competitors.In this review I‚Äôll address this from an unboxing perspective, what strikes me first as I open them up.1. Design and build quality2. Comfort3. Sound4. ANC/Voice5. Features6. SummaryDESIGN/BUILD QUALITYAs I received this box, I‚Äôm immediately struck by the weight. The product inside revealed it was not just extra packaging (though that was indeed sturdy as well). The case inside, hard case appearing to covered with color matched nylon, was indeed sturdy and holding sturdy headphones inside, as well as a USB-C cable, and an unusual inclusion of 3.5mm to USB-C cable. Both came with thoughtful cable ties and are stored in a hidden magnetic compartment. The entire interior of the case has a soft, alcantara like touch to it. Very premium and nice, though I expect the color-matched green to pick up several stains over time (will likely buy a separate black case from B&W's encompass partner). It‚Äôs less portable, but a vast improvement over the Bose case, where the Ultras tightly fit in their shortest fitment and the two cables are awkwardly crammed into a loose pouch that inevitably will sag over time. As I removed the headphones, I immediately notice the difference between this and the Bose QuietComfort Ultras. They are heavier, the materials harder, the padding thicker. When handling the Bose, I feel like I have to be handling them gingerly, as if I may break them. Indeed, there are videos of creaking ear cups, which I‚Äôve avoided, and photos of creasing headbands, which I haven‚Äôt avoided, due to the Bose‚Äôs lightweight construction. Time will tell if that happens on these B&W but I‚Äôd be surprised. Initial impression is they‚Äôre about as sturdy as you‚Äôd get for non-luxury materials. I know they aren‚Äôt as sturdy as the OG Beats Pro, which were full metal, nor as sturdy as the Px7‚Äôs flagship upgrade, the Px8, which also features aluminum arms instead of plastic, but it definitely exceeds the lightweight plastic of Bose and the recycled plastic of Sony in building confidence. The earcups have both substance and texture, covered in hard, tightly woven, nylon that wouldn‚Äôt at all feel like the ‚Äúfabric‚Äù finish of the description nor the light, thin plastic of Bose.Unlike Bose, which limits manufacturer replacement parts to just the ear cups, I was able to find replacement ear cups, deco caps, and I suspect the replacement headbands for the Px7, Px8 would be similarly compatible with the Px7 S2e if doing an out of warranty replacement. At time of writing, no replacement headband covers, cushions for my forest green selection, but black and blue is available for last gen Px7, so I‚Äôm curious to see if Bowers & Wilkins will add more replacement parts as the Px7 S2e continues its lifespan in their catalogue.The last thing I‚Äôll bring up before the comfort is specifying the design differences between these and the Px8, as the price difference between them is substantial. They share the same driver size, Bluetooth standard, case (colors vary), accessories, supported codecs. I‚Äôd expect unless listening to them side by side, what would stand out the most to most users is the increased luxury and durability of the aluminum arms and body of the Px8, and the nappa leather (allegedly) is cooler and softer over time than the synthetic leathers we see on Px7 and most other headphones. You‚Äôre paying a $200+ increase for luxury materials and (allegedly) marginally improved sound quality due to its carbon cone drivers. I think the general consumer without the trained ear wouldn‚Äôt know the latter though. It took me some time and several songs to identify the differences and limitations between Bose QuietComfort and QuietComfort Ultra from a sonic perspective. One final note for glasses users: the Bose headphones use their wake-up note to calibrate to your ears, to reproduce consistent audio experience whether or not you have glasses on. I‚Äôm not sure if the Px7s do the same with theirs, but reviews of them state that glasses do impact the bass experience. I‚Äôve yet to experience that, but I‚Äôm still becoming accustomed to their sound profile in general.COMFORTOkay, moving on. As already stated, Bose favors lightweight materials and a light clamping force to maintain comfort in their headphones. Bowers & Wilkins is heavier, and you can see just from holding them that the inward angled earcups will provide a strong clamp on the head. But does that make it uncomfortable? No. The padding on the touch surfaces are thicker than those of Bose products, and I believe it compensates for that increased clamping force.Finding a good fit was very easy. It lacks the distinct click steps of other headphones and markings to show the length, but the yokes simply glide in and out on a cable with no fuss or resistance. Unlike the Bose, which take some force to adjust, and you worry about creasing the comparably delicate headband as you shorten them to stow them away. Also, there was far more adjustment than the Bose QCUs, which require me with my average sized head to extend them fully to find a comfortable fit. Both the ‚Äúlesser‚Äù Bose QCs and the Bowers & Wilkins had plenty of extra length to offer on the yokes beyond what was required for me.Compared to the Bose QC lineups, these are heavy on the head but comfortable all day. I wore them for full work shift and even napped in them without issue.SOUND:A common criticism of Bose headphones is that they lean too heavily into a consumer sound profile, meaning, the bass is pronounced, the vocals and instruments are both lively and exciting. Far as I can tell, critics look for more of a neutral sound profile, where everything is flat and even so each layer of a given track can be clearly heard and focused upon.What I can say about the Bowers and Wilkins is that it, too has a consumer sound profile, but it doesn‚Äôt lean into it as heavily as Bose does. Bass is slightly elevated, but everything is more delicate in its delivery, which promotes clarity. Indeed, the clarity and subtlety was so precise that I discovered a new layer to the song ‚ÄúOn My Mind‚Äù by Jorja Smith and Preditah that I had missed in the dozens of playthroughs on my Bose car audio, Bose speakers, Bose headphones, Audio-Technica ATH-M50x studio monitors. It‚Äôs a new layer of precision I didn‚Äôt know existed in consumer-grade headphones and delightful to discover new things about the music.If you're accustomed to bass heavy headphones (Sony, Beats, JBL, and yes, even Bose) my suggestion is to stick with these for at least 40 hours of listening for your brain to adjust to the acoustics. Give it a chance, and that bass will lift and you‚Äôll hear it. Each day I returned to these headphones I heard the bass more and more.I‚Äôm struggling to summarize this. Perhaps I should just say where most consumer headphones prioritize forcefulness and an exciting listening experience, Bowers & Wilkins promotes clarity and subtlety so you can discover the nuance of the music you listen to. Don‚Äôt worry about volume control on these. They‚Äôre plenty loud.I will address in the ""features"" section the one concern I have about sound quality, but testing Hip-Hop, R&B, Gospel, Rock, Metal, Country, Bluegrass, Blues, Pop, EDM, and instrumental music all were a pleasant listening experience with two song exceptions (again, will elaborate). Given how infrequently I was disappointed, hard to know if it's on account of recording, quality of audio source (Spotify), or indeed a characteristic of the sound profile. I am confident that most users that give these headphones a few days use will be happy with them.ANC/VOICEAlright, not gonna lie to you, this may be the point where you‚Äôll likely jump ship if ANC is your selling point.It‚Äôs no secret that Bose and Sony are considered the industry leaders in this area right now, with Bose holding the title for best ANC in many people‚Äôs minds.I have to concur that both the QuietComfort Ultras and the ‚Äúlesser‚Äù QuietComforts are both superior in blocking external noise over the Bowers & Wilkins.I‚Äôd summarize the Bose as noise cancelling, and the Bowers & Wilkins as noise reducing in direct comparison. It‚Äôs effective enough that even with ANC off, the Px7 S2e is capable of almost entirely blocking out the 51 db metal chattering noise as the air conditioning system rattles around above my head in the office, as well as the accompanying rumble of airflow. More than enough for my needs, and I‚Äôm only aware of that external noise with no audio playing, ANC off, and if I focus to listen for that annoying sound. Meanwhile the Bose headphones just create a void of stillness to project your audio into.I think I just discovered why the Bose QuietComfort lineup forces ANC on at all times; perhaps their lightweight construction means you‚Äôll have too much noise intrusion if they allowed you to disable it.Depending on how you look at it, that‚Äôs a point for or against the Px7 S2e. The ANC is not as strong, but you have passive playback options that are still potentially more than enough for your use case (and increase battery life). I also feel none of the ‚Äúcabin pressure‚Äù that Bose puts on the ears to deliver that ANC.For phone calls, I received feedback that my voice is clear on both the Bose and Bowers & Wilkins headphones. However, in a phone call I tested both (indoors with fans, outdoors with wind) I did have to occasionally repeat myself on the Px7 S2e. Seems the adaptive functions of the Bose identified and isolate my voice better. Makes sense. The Bose up to four more microphones for ANC and Voice duties than the Px7 S2e, depending on which you choose. So if phone calls are a primary use case, worth noting. Still superior to the original AirPods Pro on all three choices.FEATURES:-All the Bose, B&W headphones I tested have companion apps and offer multipoint pairing.-All have 6+ mics for ANC, Voice.-All offer at least 3 ANC modes of Quiet and Awareness/Passthrough-Bose QC Ultra and Px7/S2e, Px8 all have 40 mm drivers.-All have wired and wireless options.I think that Bose‚Äôs UI is more accessible and customizable for the typical user. It allows you to adjust a three band graphic EQ (bass, mid, treble), manage device connections, ANC profiles.Bowers & Wilkins has only a two band EQ for treble and bass, like your automobile stereo. It also has device connection management and ANC functions. It also has annoying prompts to add several streaming services into the app, which would absolutely be useful if I was a Tidal user, but I‚Äôm not. They can‚Äôt be removed at all.I think this is where the sound profile of Bowers & Wilkins may be at a disadvantage. Since many vocals reside in the mid-range, on two tracks that I felt the vocals were slightly recessed behind the treble and bass (""Unparalyzed"" by Caleb Hyles, ""Bring Me to Life"" by Evanescence), there's no way to lift the vocals in the Graphic EQ other than turning treble and bass down. The Bose headphones I tested as competition to these undeniably has an advantage in this area, having a tri-band Graphic EQ (but both fall short of the immense customization from companies like Marshall and Sony within their companion apps).Both apps tend to forget that they‚Äôre connected to the headphones in as much as I periodically had to refresh them to customize the aforementioned settings, but the B&W was slightly more annoying because I‚Äôd have to force close the app and reopen rather than the Bose drag down, release, refresh method.Only a bother if you‚Äôre frequently changing settings.CONCLUSION:Where this generation of Bose headphones is exciting, immersive and forceful in its playback, Bowers & Wilkins delivers on its claim of clarity, subtlety, and nuance in a truly premium package.What it lacks in ANC tech it answers with plush, isolating comfort. It answers lightweight materials with durable and pleasant to the touch materials and elegance.If you want a refined audio experience and entry-level luxury audio, skip Bose and get these. The price of them is not consistent with its craftsmanship, and the audio, while so enjoyable, is matched by many less expensive options. That‚Äôs why I ultimately picked these.If you want portability, the best ANC technology for air travel, frequent conferencing, or want the virtual soundstage/Immsersive Audio/Spatial Audio to get more out of TV/movies, you‚Äôll want to consider the Bose QC, QC Ultra.I think you‚Äôd enjoy all of them, but as I stated, at $249 on sale for Prime Day, I had to go for the Bowers & Wilkins as my pick out of the three. At their comparative sale prices, it‚Äôs the best built, the most refined sound, luxurious, and priced right between both Bose offerings.Even at full price, $349.99, I‚Äôd say the Px7 S2e are worth the additional $50 over the QuietComfort 2023s, and better in some ways than the $429.99 QuietComfort Ultras.Hope this can help inform your headphones research!Read more"

"LEVN Wireless Headset, Wireless Headset with Mic for Work, AI Noise Cancelling, 65 Hrs Working Time, Bluetooth Headphones with Microphone from Home/Computer/Call Center/Teams",$69.98,4.8 out of 5 stars,253,"Let me preface this by saying I‚Äôve been through more headsets than a call center in prime telemarketing season. Each one promised a symphony of crystal-clear audio and a cone of silence, only to deliver static, muffled voices, and the distinct sound of my neighbor's leaf blower making an impromptu appearance in my virtual meetings. My expectations, like my patience, were wearing thin.Then, these beauties arrived. Now, I won't lie, when I first unboxed them, I had that familiar skepticism. ""Here we go again,"" I thought, ""another set of ear warmers that will let my colleagues hear my dog snoring."" Oh, how delightfully wrong I was!The first call I took with these on, it was like a magic trick. My usually bustling home office, a cacophony of children practicing their ""interpretive dance"" (read: jumping off furniture), a washing machine attempting lift-off, and the aforementioned dog's surprisingly loud breathing, suddenly‚Ä¶ vanished. It was silent. I heard my colleague perfectly, and more importantly, they heard me! No more ""Can you repeat that? It sounds like you're in a wind tunnel!"" It was pure, unadulterated, professional audio bliss. The noise reduction on these things isn't just good; it's practically sorcery. I half-expected to see tiny, invisible sound-absorbing gnomes working tirelessly within the earcups.And the noise-canceling? Forget about it. I put on some focus music, and my entire world narrowed down to the task at hand. The kids could be staging a full-blown opera in the next room, and I'd be blissfully unaware, charting my way through spreadsheets like a zen master. It's almost too good; I've nearly missed several important ""Mom, I need juice NOW!"" emergencies. My family now communicates with me via interpretive dance and elaborate hand signals when I have these on, which, frankly, is an unexpected bonus for my daily dose of humor.Now, let's talk about the sheer joy of connectivity. These aren't just good for calls; the wireless and Bluetooth connectivity is rock solid. I can wander off to grab a coffee (or escape the aforementioned interpretive dance) and not drop a single word of my meeting. No more getting tethered to my desk like a sad office plant. And speaking of freedom, the reversible boom mic is a stroke of genius! Whether you're a right-ear loyalist or a left-ear aficionado, you can swing that microphone around with effortless grace. It‚Äôs the little things, you know? Like being able to switch ears when one starts to feel a bit warm after a particularly lengthy webinar.Then there's the delightful simplicity of control. No more fumbling blindly for tiny, unidentifiable buttons. The easy-access volume controls are right where your thumb expects them to be, and the on/off button is so intuitive, even my tech-averse grandmother could manage it (if she were interested in joining my online meetings, which, thankfully, she is not).But the real unsung hero here is the charging base. Gone are the days of fumbling with tiny USB cables, trying to plug them into a microscopic port in the dark, only to realize I've been trying to charge my nail clippers. Now, it's just a satisfying ""clunk"" as I set them down, knowing they'll be fully juiced and ready for my next deep dive into professional solitude. It's so convenient, I'm considering getting a charging base for my keys, my phone, and maybe even my coffee mug.In short, if you're tired of background noise dominating your calls, want to actually hear what people are saying, crave seamless wireless freedom, appreciate intuitive controls, and want the flexibility of a reversible mic, do yourself a favor and get these. Just be prepared for the strange looks you'll get when you confidently ask your kids if they enjoyed their silent, mimed afternoon.Read more"

"Sennheiser MOMENTUM 4 Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth for Crystal-Clear Calls w/Adaptive Noise Cancellation, 60h Battery Life, Customizable Sound & Lightweight Folding Design, Graphite",$265.95,4.0 out of 5 stars,"7,609","5 stars to me. 4 stars all around for the average consumer due to issues I believe others will find a problem with but I have found some workarounds forI will start off with the flaws (unfortunately it has em) from my experience and some solutions. They are mostly features based. I'll also address confusions and ""negative"" experiences as there are reviews where clearly it's the people and not the headphones that are the problem yet they are giving this a worse impression that it should have. And lastly praise what it has going well for itAlso, I will highly suggest downloading the new app version called smart control PLUS and install any firmware updates. Then go adjust settings or it will have some annoyances.FlawsOn-head detection: this causes most of the headaches. For those that like to free up an ear to listen to someone talk better - make a habit of freeing your left ear and not the right. There is a sensor to detect your ear and it is only INSIDE the right earcup.  It makes a double click noise when it detects and stops detecting your ear. Unfortunately it makes a similar sound for both which is a huge flaw as you might not know if it is detecting or not sometimes. This will trigger the auto off feature if it doesn't detect you while you're listening to music. It usually pauses from the headset, but there is a possibility it can be ignored by an app and continue playing so when you put it back on you might not even know if it detected you. Another possibility is you made the mistake of pressing play from the app itself when it stops detecting you thus eventually triggering the sleep feature. You can disable auto off but I personally put it in 1 hour just in case as I would have likely readjusted my headset by that point and reset it. This goes into the next feature: auto play. It's perfectly fine on mobile but on PC it can be a nightmare as you could be listening to music, you adjust your right earcup so it pauses and when you put it back on, it might play some other video like youtube in an open browser; it depends on the programs that behave to bluetooth pause/play. So don't have so many open video/audio programs in the background. Also for those with long hair, autoplay can struggle to detect if it completely covers your right ear (some people start to think it stopped working). Overall, I just disabled autoplay while keeping auto-off enabled as I mainly use the M4 on PC, but again, it seems to work really well on mobile. Plus of course if any of these aren't necessary to you, you can simply disable it as a whole for an old fashioned headphone experience to avoid annoyances but I have gotten used to it at this point that I rarely have issues [Update: I just learned on May 2025 that as of the new firmware 2.13.42 it reads ""Improved auto-off behavior reducing unexpected behavior during calls or streaming due to misdetection in smart pause sensor"", so perhaps this section might become untrue with less flaws down the road thus hopefully improving user experience]Multi- point connection: It can and will connect to two devices that have bluetooth active after they have been paired. There are individuals that pair their headphones to everything and might experience a random connection. Unfortunately no disabling this so you have to be precise with what you want to connect this with. I only paired this to PC and mobile so it doesn't attempt to connect to anything else but in the app you can click to what else in the list want to connect to (or delete). When it detects multiple signals it will prioritize connecting to what you last used, it seems. Not an issue for me. Also, it will ALWAYS prioritize audio for the first connection of the two which will usually be the phone. This is important. If it connects to my phone first, well lets say Im on the PC listening to music, once your phone makes any kind of sound, your audio will switch to it and interrupt the music, then resume playing your PC's music. Because of this, disable useless sounds like the lock screen opening sounds because that will trigger a switch (not sure about typing sounds). I have sound on for notifications to get my attention for the phone but if that is an annoyance I would try connecting other devices (like PC) as your main device first and then phone second. That way, it will ONLY play audio on the main device (PC) in spite of your phone making noises or playing audio. I tend to disable phone bluetooth, so it isn't an issue for me what connects first anyways. Now, this is a major flaw which may have been addressed in the new firmware update and app but I have not fully tested yet so this is based on months old experience. Last flaw with this. Do not have constant audio playing on -BOTH- devices because it will cause some static to what you are listening to. No idea why this happens but sometimes the music sounds glitchy and I realize it's because my PC is playing music alongside my phone. All it takes is not having something like music playing on the second device and it gets clean.Reboot: it can be done on the power button after holding for over 15 seconds. Be careful NOT to do this if it is not your intention. I have a friend who accidentally did thisHigh resolution: app is glitched if you try to do personalized sound after enabling high resolution. It will ask you to disable high resolution before proceeding. All you have to do is go to standard mode, make your sound profile, then go back and enable High Resolution.Confusions:ANC: some people complain you can't turn off ANC. You sort of can. Old app, on the ANC slide, you put the slider in the middle. Most importantly, the new version of the app now allows to turn off ANC and might possibly increase your battery life. Oh, and some people remark of ANC randomly activating when outside. That is the wind noise reduction activating during air blowing directly to your mics. You can turn it off in ANC settings (you can also adjust transparency during phone calls there) but trust me that you don't want to hear wind transmitted into a headsetAuto-answer calls: complaints on this but another reason you need the app to disable it if you don't want it.Aut-connect: some complain that if it moves it will auto connect or cause confusion when they don't know why their bluetooth loud speakers stopped working until they realize the headphones are connected. I personally love auto connect and has never been an issue. I put my headphones away where it won't move at all and once I grab it, boom, just straightforward and smooth connection grab and go. This is a feature of auto off so if you don't want it to be doing this you can either disable auto off (more like sleep) or turn off the headphones directly from the power button (which means you will also have to turn it back on with the button). I don't think of it as a flaw to be honestDiscord/meeting calls: This is a big one. There are people mentioning how when they get on discord, their music and game sounds muffled. That is its hands free activating because it believes you are in a call. It prioritizes the call once it is activating its mic. You may have noticed it on your phone before too with music getting muffled. Problem is these then get compared directly to a gaming headset. Most gaming headsets have a usb dongle. Those dongles are designed to give both high quality low latency audio and mic signals at the same time. These? They are bluetooth headsets not specifically designed for gaming but rather for high quality audio. This is not a major fault of the headset. There exists a workaround for this but you will have to disable handsfree and rely on a different mic (which can be a far superior option anyways). To do this - on windows 11, go to settings. Click ""bluetooth & devices"". Then click on ""view more devices"" up top to go to a drop down list of devices. Scroll all the way down until you find ""more devices and printer settings"". Find the M4 headset, right click and go to properties. Click on the hardware tab. On this list, look for Name ""Momentum 4 Hands-Free"" that is under Type ""Sound, Video..."". Click once on it then click on properties below. In properties, General tab, click on the blue and yellow shield that says Change Settings. Then go to the Driver tab and Click Disable Driver. Reboot PC. Can be undone in similar method. At this point it has no headset mic active ~specifically~ on the PC (phone should be unaffected) so audio will be clear but now an external mic will be needed.Experiences:Connectivity: people say they have connectivity issues but thankfully it is very rare for me. It has a good distance to it too. I keep up to date with everything on my phoneTouchpad: some say it is very sensitive. It is certainly more sensitive than usual but there are exaggerations to it. My hair does not trigger it. Turning my head does not trigger it. I don't trigger it with a hoodie on. I don't wear beanies over it (why would you?) so I cant say anything there. Stretching my arms above my head might trigger and laying my head on the right side might make it think you want to change volume or transparency. But some of these reviews are funny. They are not rated to be water resistant at all (like most headsets) so if rain drops trigger it, actually no, WHY DO YOU EVEN HAVE IT IN THE RAIN?App: the app is fine minus the glitch [refer to High Resolution in Flaws] and has only been improving bit by bit. There's now also a new version which requires a new download that will likely be getting more of a focus onDurability: it is plastic which makes it lighter but thankfully I have not broken anything. I have bumped it into things, dropped it once. I try to treat is as glass so these are rare occurrences. I would not work out in these due to the fact they are not designed to deal with liquid. If problems occur because you work out in these, well that's your fault, but there exist rubber sweat covers to put over the padding to help out a bit. The Sennheisers Momentum 4/Sport earbuds I believe have water resistance and might be worth a look instead if you need a true gym companionStrengthsAudio quality: right out of the box, they are great. It has a neutral sound profile while having some attention to bass. There are presets in the app that are decent and it really does not need a bass booster but it exists. To be honest, I would skip everything and go straight for the sound personalization feature in the app. It's very simple to adjust, uses mostly sliders while you listen to audio. And once you are done it will create a setting that somehow manages to be far superior than what's already available in the app. It just cleans up the sound so much more to your liking; the difference is bewildering. Ever since that point, I have not listened to music the same. Just when I thought I was getting bored of music, these revived that love to want to listen to everything again and also motivated me to listen to things I never did before. There is literally pre-Sennheiser and during-Sennheiser eras to me now and am curious to their wired headsets. One thing that will become super noticeable is its soundstage. It spreads the instruments to a degree where you can notice more of everything. Albeit, this can be discombobulating and bassheads might not like the lack of sharp precision but this isn't meant to be your average linear listening experience (the Accentum Plus offers this at a much lower price). To give an example: What is Life by George Harrison. I might prefer it on the more linear style I am used to but these can separate things to the point where it is also directional and you can feel like you are standing at a concert and George is directly in the middle of it all in front of you so it feels more real- similar to as if you are becoming conscious of your own breathing. And in midst of all the chaos, you can still clearly hear George's voice and you notice ALL of the instruments more. It first gave me goosebumps how much it changed the song. Some songs are designed to be ""linear"" which could possibly affect emotional type of songs negatively but from a musical perspective, my goodness it is incredible. Now I just go back to see what music I am used to that changes with these (hint: a lot). Electronic/hip-hop music perhaps is the exception but this gives such clarity to detail that it is still a great listen- one thing is for sure these headsets love when there is a band setup (Bjork, the Roots, Gorillaz, etc). Sound quality is the biggest reason you go for these.Comfort: I can go on for a while without my ears hurting or anything. Also these don't heat up much and has proper adjustability for bigger headsLook: I have the black with copper ring and they are absolutely gorgeous. I question the longevity of the cloth on the headstrap but it makes it more beautiful than it has any business being for a plastic headsetFeatures: ANC is better than I expected. It does its job, and though it might not lead in this category, the differences are so small compared to the competition. Also drowned out what I needed it to during plane trips. And hearthrough, although I have had better, they will more than suffice to the point where I rarely have any issues hearing people. The fact that it is good at both of these is amazing for value.Battery: they can go up to nearly 60 hours, especially in standard mode. Not an exaggeration. I can go days without charging them. For this quality of headset, I don't think much of the competition comes close to this. In fact this is the mind blowing part because most other bluetooth headsets don't sound anywhere as good as these and they have half the battery life if not worse. No fears when travelling that it will die on me. In fact, it lasted me an entire week's tripSurprisesGaming: it has low enough latency. Combine that with that very clean audio and surprising directional audio this already has and wow, it performs quite well. I can actually spot details better and sometimes extra details I wasn't aware like I remember distinctly many months ago when I played Paladins, not only was I able to hear behind a wall slightly above me, but I realized it was subtle high heel sounds. I am not saying this will replace top of the line gaming headsets like steel series but if you have these and not a gaming headset, these will more than suffice.Charging: I was already enamored by the battery life but the fact is, it handles charging nearly as well. You can get hours worth per 10 minutes of charging and around an hour and a half or so it will be fully charged. That may not sound great but half of that will net you 30 hours of life which is STILL more than the competition. And the other surprise was that I accidentally discovered on the PC that you can still use it while charging - it simply appears as a different sound output you have to switch to. I thought it was weird how multiple momentum 4's appeared but when I clicked the other output, music started booming through it again. I was shocked. It already has a super long battery life with quick charging. It doesn't need it yet it has it. I have never had a headset that allows that with USB-C. Sennheiser were practically showing off at this point. So I would get a super long cable to make this comfortable during charging if you think this is a feature you will be usingThese are already the greatest -bluetooth- headsets I have ever owned under the $500 mark. I have tried out direct competitors Airpods Max (best hearthrough and good clean quality) and Sony Xm5's (amazing features and stylish) but the M4 felt like a no brainer. The max have poor battery life (under 20 hours) meanwhile these can reach close to triple that. The XM5's are light and so smooth with their features and touchpad (I loved speak to chat) but their fragility comes into question as they are notorious for the hinges breaking no matter how good you take care of them while the M4's mostly have earpads wearing down (easily replaceable). Meanwhile, guess what? The M4's imo sound better than both of them, are more comfortable than both, and can be found MUCH cheaper than both as I have seen it as low as $190. Even if, say, the Bowers & Wilkins PX8 might have slightly better audio and a better build, it's not a major difference so it is imo horrifically overpriced while this just has much higher value after sales and is an easier recommendationOverall, it absolutely bothers me just how overrated the other headsets on Amazon usually are meanwhile these get a bad impression. If you are a fan of music and you want to improve that experience with the bluetooth format at great affordability, it doesn't get better than theseRead more"

"Otium Bluetooth Earbuds Wireless Headphones Bluetooth Headphones, Sports Earbuds, IPX7 Waterproof Stereo Earphones for Gym Running 15 Hours Playtime Sound Isolation Headsets,Black",$15.79,4.3 out of 5 stars,"17,028","I have purchased a similar pair of Bluetooth headphones from another company that was at the time considered an ‚ÄúAmazon Choice‚Äù because of their high ratings and economical price point. I have actively used them for the last few months and was asked by Otium to try their product.Shipping was fast (I received the headphones in two days), and the next morning opened up my shipment to try the headphones out.Packaging was simple to get into‚Äîno tape or plastic wrap covering the product; only a cardboard sleeve with the box that contained the headphones. Upon opening, everything was neatly packaged, and there was no damage to any of the inner contents.The zipper case containing the headphones displayed the Otium company logo on the outside of it, was black in color and had a carabiner attached to it so you could carry it on a backpack, purse, belt loop, or anything that you could think of to connect it to. Inside the case was the headphones, and two additional sizes of earpieces and a plastic cinch to keep the wire between the right and left side of the headphones from flopping around. Also, in the box was a USB cable to charge the headphones, a warranty card that gives the customer an additional 6-month free warranty for buying the product and an instruction manual explaining the use of the headphones, including troubleshooting, and also what is allowed and not allowed with the waterproof feature of the headphones, which I will get to later in this review.The first thing the instructions suggest is to charge the product entirely, which takes 1-2 hours to charge. When I plugged the USB into my laptop, it only took a little less than an hour to charge the headphones fully. The one thing I noticed immediately about the headphones that the ones I had purchased a few months earlier were that the part that wraps around the ear to keep them in place was stiffer than my previous ones. I liked that because the other headphones had a very flimsy ear wrap.Connecting them to my iPhone X was simple and easy. You hold the power button down for a total of eight seconds to pair to your phone. Then, you go to your Bluetooth settings, and either the name ‚ÄúOtium‚Äù will appear (depending on your phone), or you will need to type in a password for it, which is ‚Äú0000‚Äù. After pairing your headphones to your phone, you are ready to go. You also have the option for ‚Äúmulti-pairing‚Äù to two devices, which I thought was a cool feature!As far as the buttons, the power button (located on the right side) turns on/off the headphones, pairs the headphones to up to two devices and answers/ends/rejects phone calls/redials the last number called. You can also transfer/pause/play audio with the power button. The volume controls allow you to mute the microphone/turn up and down the volume and move forward/reverse audio tracks that you are listening to.You can talk up to 8 hours, which I will admit I have never tried, and they state that the standby time is close to 220 hours, which is all dependent on usage.The headphones sound great! The voices come in clear, and there is a decent amount of bass, which I tend to like. The earphones stay in my ear, which is another feature I appreciate, considering that the Apple earbuds and other headsets I have tried in the past have not fit well in my ears (I must have a larger left ear canal, because that is the side that all of my earphones would fall out of!). The wire connecting the earphones stays out of my way, and I usually don‚Äôt use the cinch, because I am a bigger person in size, and do not like having something constricting in the back of my head. The ear wrap is comfortable around my ears, the only downfall is that they are not adjustable for different ear sizes, but they are flexible to fit around different ear sizes of most people. The earbuds allow a for some noise isolation ‚Äì another great feature! The volume sounds pretty good at different levels; it becomes just a little distorted at higher volumes. I‚Äôve seen a few negative reviews that have mentioned that they have difficulty pairing to their phone after a period using the Bluetooth headphones, but I have not used them long enough to experience that problem. The box does give information on how to contact them if there are any technical problems, so if anything does happen in the future, I will try to reach out to them and see how they handle customer service issues. Finally, the price point is perfect! With other higher-end headphones on the market, for an economical pair of headphones, these are great!The only negatives are first, the volume buttons. I‚Äôm used to holding down on the button on older earbuds due to my age (LOL!), and I keep forgetting that it will skip to the next song or go back to the previous song. However, I‚Äôm slowly getting used to repeatedly clicking to turn up/down the volume, so it is something that is a minor complaint that I can quickly get over. Secondly, I was listening to Amazon Prime Music on my iPhone through these headphones and paused the music to hear what my wife was saying at the time. When I went to play the music as instructed in the manual, it would not restart the music. I had to open the app and manually press the play button to continue listening to music. That was frustrating. If I was driving down the road while listening to music, it is inconvenient to go to look down at my phone and keep driving down the road and risk having an accident happen. I did try listening to a podcast and tried pausing and playing using the same process, and it worked, so it is a software issue, which I hope Amazon would fix in the future.Now, I told you that I would mention what you can get away with when it comes to water. The instruction manual states that you can get away with splashes, rain, snow, incidental exposure to water up to 1 meter for up to 30 minutes, and believe it or not, showering! Seriously! Who showers with headphones on?! I am nervous to try that, but it would be interesting to see if it would actually withstand a shower!Situations it cannot withstand when it comes to water is swimming or any type of watersports, which makes perfect sense.I would honestly recommend these headphones for the ease of use, quality and price point! I gave my wife the headphones I previously purchased and have used these full-time! These are great headphones! Buy yours today!Read more"
Sennheiser HD 599 SE Around Ear Open Back Headphone - Black,$99.95,4.6 out of 5 stars,"9,628","I primarily use these for gaming or watching videos, listening to music on YouTube. I'm not an audiophile but I really enjoy my ""me time"" on my PC so I want it to be a high quality experience. These deliver on every level.I don't really play many games that need a mic so I just bought an in-line mic add-on from a 3rd party made specifically for these headphones and attached it. It's a cheap boom mic but it picks up fine.The MOST important thing for me is comfort. I have fallen asleep with these on multiple times. It never leaves my ears or scalp sore. I used to have a pair of Astro A40s because of how comfortable they were, but these are superior in just about every way. These are absolutely worth the price if you can afford them. I've had mine for about 5 months. They're the best headphones I've ever used. I bought a nice little SoundBlaster DAC/soundcard to go with them to make sure I got the full range of the headphones and it made a big difference. These are phenomenal. I couldn't be more pleased with them. I plan on using these for as long as they will last, which judging by the high quality materials, I think they'll last many years just like my Astro A40s did.COMFORT: These fit OVER my ears. So many headphones are called ""over-ear"" yet lay on top of my ears. I have detached ear lobes so most headphones lay on my ear lobes slightly and after a few hours will make my ears sore. The clamp strength is also a huge factor. I have a big fat head (because I'm so smart) and most headphones start to feel too snug after awhile. These never do. I've fallen asleep for 6+ hours before at my PC and woke up, forgot I was wearing these, and never felt any discomfort. It's like they were made by a benevolent God just for my cranium. The top of the headphones never press down on the top of my scalp in an uncomfortable way either. The head cushion on my Astro A40s would get uncomfortable after extended sessions but I swear these NEVER do me wrong. These are a gift from heaven and I love them dearly. If you care about audio quality and comfort above all else, you will be pleased with these.Read more"

I own the Sony WF1000's and they are sorta the bench mark so I will try and have a balanced approach when review the Flybud 3.Sound 4 - Great mid range sound.  As much bass as I would every want and overall really good.  I have others that I prefer for audio books (but hat is because they are ""Bright"" and easy to hear voices) but like these for all general use listening.  My Sony's have a lot more detail and a broader sound stage, but without a side by side you would be hard pressed to tell the different when moving around.  I really only notice the Sony's awesomeness while sitting and concentrating on the music.  Moving around and living life in motion... I find myself grabbing the Flybuds when I am going to go work out for otherswise.Fit - These stick in you ear like an great set of earplugs.  The noise ISSOLATION is the best I have by far.  So good that in some case are quieter than my NC version of headphones where NC can actually amplifiy noise more so than cancel it... for example wind noise.  The ear wings and the ear tips are great and the most secure TWB I own by far.Battery - I have yet to every run our of battery in the case and cant recall every running out of batter in the TWBs... so batter life is great.  The ability to charge and external devise has saved me a few times.  The case is a little heavy but slick (good/bad) and slides into pockets easily.  I find it a little heavy for when I am wear light shorts or dress clothes, but would be the pair I took if I was to go on a road trip.Gripes - None really... except for the limited MultiFunction aspects of the MFB.  I would have liked to see volume added and skip back/forth be implemented in the MFB... but I have learn to live without it.FLYBUD NCFirst... I would give them a (3) start when using the stock ear-tips.  The noise isolation (vs the noise cancellation) with the stock ear-tips was terrible so I put a different set of ear-tips and that made a HUGE difference... HUGE.Fortunately Tribit acknowledges such a possibility and as a result just sent me a notice to get (3) new designed  ear-tips sent my way.  I am anxious to try them to see how they do.  In the end this is not an uncommon issue and I find that keeping old ear-tips around so as to swap them to those that work best is a good practice and something I have done with pretty much all the TWB's I own.Packaging 5:  nice as with all the Tribit products I have bought... Its nice and clean and simpleCase (4) :  Nice and small, but doesn't let you use some of the bigger ear-tips from other TWB's as the charging pins to make contact.  The case has 4 little lights on the front as the battery indicator and they seems to drop fast.  I often find it at 50% and I am thinking ""didn't i just charge that case?""... only to reflect back with the understanding that I had been using them constantly for the past couple of days... so I suspect the hours claimed are correct.... I just got use to the Flybud 3' monster 2600mah battery case and seeing those battery lights rarely fall below 75%.  lol.Earbud Battery (5) - They say 8 to 10 hrs for the earbud... that is awesome and I have no reason not to believe it.  I have yet to wear them out, but the longest I wore them was likely 3hrs to 4hrs... so your experience my vary, but for the record I have gotten ""low battery"" warnings on all my other earbuds BUT the Flybud NC's.  kudo on the battery life.Earbud Sound  (4) - Great for the price.  They are not as detailed as my Sony 1000's (they are very nice and detailed, but cost $200), but are nice in the mids with bass where you need it.  I listen to the a lot of podcast and I find the sound of the FB-NC's to be well balanced and I don't get fatigued listening over an extended period of time.  If I didn't have the Sony's to compare them I would give them a 5.  Great sound for the price.Earbud Noise Cancellation (4) - as noted WITH the different ear-tips installed the NC is really good for white noise and general background noise.  I would say it cuts down that ""sort of noise"" by 60 to 70% and works great.  Again the Sony's do it better, but without a side by side comparison you would likely not be able to tell the difference between the Tribits and the Sonys.  NC works great in office/inside environments... Very nice for car rides and plane rides and such, but not so good for outside when there is wind blowing (an issue with the Sony's as well).  The wind disrupts the ""NC"" aspects of the earbuds and can cause more noise... the good thing is you can turn it off and use them like normal TWB.  The pass-thru aspect is very nice to have and I find I use it more than I expected.  Nice feature.Some grips:- They stay in good with different ear-tips, but not very well with the stock ear-tips.- They don't have volume control and some of the other aspects of other TWB's multi-touch button, but I have learned to live with it.I find that:- I carry these FB-NC's now when I leave the house.- I carry the Flybud 3 now whenever I am going to go do anything active, especially outside where Noise Cancellation is less effective and Noise Isolation is most important... something (noise isolation) the Flybud 3's do better than any other TWB i have tried- I use my sony's when I really want to get lost in the music and isolate myself.  They are very impressive and create a detailed sound stage that none of the other TWB's I have tried can do... but again they cost 5 times as much.Hope this helps.Read more"

"Sennheiser MOMENTUM 4 Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth for Crystal-Clear Calls w/Adaptive Noise Cancellation, 60h Battery Life, Customizable Sound & Lightweight Folding Design, Graphite",$265.95,4.0 out of 5 stars,"7,609","5 stars to me. 4 stars all around for the average consumer due to issues I believe others will find a problem with but I have found some workarounds forI will start off with the flaws (unfortunately it has em) from my experience and some solutions. They are mostly features based. I'll also address confusions and ""negative"" experiences as there are reviews where clearly it's the people and not the headphones that are the problem yet they are giving this a worse impression that it should have. And lastly praise what it has going well for itAlso, I will highly suggest downloading the new app version called smart control PLUS and install any firmware updates. Then go adjust settings or it will have some annoyances.FlawsOn-head detection: this causes most of the headaches. For those that like to free up an ear to listen to someone talk better - make a habit of freeing your left ear and not the right. There is a sensor to detect your ear and it is only INSIDE the right earcup.  It makes a double click noise when it detects and stops detecting your ear. Unfortunately it makes a similar sound for both which is a huge flaw as you might not know if it is detecting or not sometimes. This will trigger the auto off feature if it doesn't detect you while you're listening to music. It usually pauses from the headset, but there is a possibility it can be ignored by an app and continue playing so when you put it back on you might not even know if it detected you. Another possibility is you made the mistake of pressing play from the app itself when it stops detecting you thus eventually triggering the sleep feature. You can disable auto off but I personally put it in 1 hour just in case as I would have likely readjusted my headset by that point and reset it. This goes into the next feature: auto play. It's perfectly fine on mobile but on PC it can be a nightmare as you could be listening to music, you adjust your right earcup so it pauses and when you put it back on, it might play some other video like youtube in an open browser; it depends on the programs that behave to bluetooth pause/play. So don't have so many open video/audio programs in the background. Also for those with long hair, autoplay can struggle to detect if it completely covers your right ear (some people start to think it stopped working). Overall, I just disabled autoplay while keeping auto-off enabled as I mainly use the M4 on PC, but again, it seems to work really well on mobile. Plus of course if any of these aren't necessary to you, you can simply disable it as a whole for an old fashioned headphone experience to avoid annoyances but I have gotten used to it at this point that I rarely have issues [Update: I just learned on May 2025 that as of the new firmware 2.13.42 it reads ""Improved auto-off behavior reducing unexpected behavior during calls or streaming due to misdetection in smart pause sensor"", so perhaps this section might become untrue with less flaws down the road thus hopefully improving user experience]Multi- point connection: It can and will connect to two devices that have bluetooth active after they have been paired. There are individuals that pair their headphones to everything and might experience a random connection. Unfortunately no disabling this so you have to be precise with what you want to connect this with. I only paired this to PC and mobile so it doesn't attempt to connect to anything else but in the app you can click to what else in the list want to connect to (or delete). When it detects multiple signals it will prioritize connecting to what you last used, it seems. Not an issue for me. Also, it will ALWAYS prioritize audio for the first connection of the two which will usually be the phone. This is important. If it connects to my phone first, well lets say Im on the PC listening to music, once your phone makes any kind of sound, your audio will switch to it and interrupt the music, then resume playing your PC's music. Because of this, disable useless sounds like the lock screen opening sounds because that will trigger a switch (not sure about typing sounds). I have sound on for notifications to get my attention for the phone but if that is an annoyance I would try connecting other devices (like PC) as your main device first and then phone second. That way, it will ONLY play audio on the main device (PC) in spite of your phone making noises or playing audio. I tend to disable phone bluetooth, so it isn't an issue for me what connects first anyways. Now, this is a major flaw which may have been addressed in the new firmware update and app but I have not fully tested yet so this is based on months old experience. Last flaw with this. Do not have constant audio playing on -BOTH- devices because it will cause some static to what you are listening to. No idea why this happens but sometimes the music sounds glitchy and I realize it's because my PC is playing music alongside my phone. All it takes is not having something like music playing on the second device and it gets clean.Reboot: it can be done on the power button after holding for over 15 seconds. Be careful NOT to do this if it is not your intention. I have a friend who accidentally did thisHigh resolution: app is glitched if you try to do personalized sound after enabling high resolution. It will ask you to disable high resolution before proceeding. All you have to do is go to standard mode, make your sound profile, then go back and enable High Resolution.Confusions:ANC: some people complain you can't turn off ANC. You sort of can. Old app, on the ANC slide, you put the slider in the middle. Most importantly, the new version of the app now allows to turn off ANC and might possibly increase your battery life. Oh, and some people remark of ANC randomly activating when outside. That is the wind noise reduction activating during air blowing directly to your mics. You can turn it off in ANC settings (you can also adjust transparency during phone calls there) but trust me that you don't want to hear wind transmitted into a headsetAuto-answer calls: complaints on this but another reason you need the app to disable it if you don't want it.Aut-connect: some complain that if it moves it will auto connect or cause confusion when they don't know why their bluetooth loud speakers stopped working until they realize the headphones are connected. I personally love auto connect and has never been an issue. I put my headphones away where it won't move at all and once I grab it, boom, just straightforward and smooth connection grab and go. This is a feature of auto off so if you don't want it to be doing this you can either disable auto off (more like sleep) or turn off the headphones directly from the power button (which means you will also have to turn it back on with the button). I don't think of it as a flaw to be honestDiscord/meeting calls: This is a big one. There are people mentioning how when they get on discord, their music and game sounds muffled. That is its hands free activating because it believes you are in a call. It prioritizes the call once it is activating its mic. You may have noticed it on your phone before too with music getting muffled. Problem is these then get compared directly to a gaming headset. Most gaming headsets have a usb dongle. Those dongles are designed to give both high quality low latency audio and mic signals at the same time. These? They are bluetooth headsets not specifically designed for gaming but rather for high quality audio. This is not a major fault of the headset. There exists a workaround for this but you will have to disable handsfree and rely on a different mic (which can be a far superior option anyways). To do this - on windows 11, go to settings. Click ""bluetooth & devices"". Then click on ""view more devices"" up top to go to a drop down list of devices. Scroll all the way down until you find ""more devices and printer settings"". Find the M4 headset, right click and go to properties. Click on the hardware tab. On this list, look for Name ""Momentum 4 Hands-Free"" that is under Type ""Sound, Video..."". Click once on it then click on properties below. In properties, General tab, click on the blue and yellow shield that says Change Settings. Then go to the Driver tab and Click Disable Driver. Reboot PC. Can be undone in similar method. At this point it has no headset mic active ~specifically~ on the PC (phone should be unaffected) so audio will be clear but now an external mic will be needed.Experiences:Connectivity: people say they have connectivity issues but thankfully it is very rare for me. It has a good distance to it too. I keep up to date with everything on my phoneTouchpad: some say it is very sensitive. It is certainly more sensitive than usual but there are exaggerations to it. My hair does not trigger it. Turning my head does not trigger it. I don't trigger it with a hoodie on. I don't wear beanies over it (why would you?) so I cant say anything there. Stretching my arms above my head might trigger and laying my head on the right side might make it think you want to change volume or transparency. But some of these reviews are funny. They are not rated to be water resistant at all (like most headsets) so if rain drops trigger it, actually no, WHY DO YOU EVEN HAVE IT IN THE RAIN?App: the app is fine minus the glitch [refer to High Resolution in Flaws] and has only been improving bit by bit. There's now also a new version which requires a new download that will likely be getting more of a focus onDurability: it is plastic which makes it lighter but thankfully I have not broken anything. I have bumped it into things, dropped it once. I try to treat is as glass so these are rare occurrences. I would not work out in these due to the fact they are not designed to deal with liquid. If problems occur because you work out in these, well that's your fault, but there exist rubber sweat covers to put over the padding to help out a bit. The Sennheisers Momentum 4/Sport earbuds I believe have water resistance and might be worth a look instead if you need a true gym companionStrengthsAudio quality: right out of the box, they are great. It has a neutral sound profile while having some attention to bass. There are presets in the app that are decent and it really does not need a bass booster but it exists. To be honest, I would skip everything and go straight for the sound personalization feature in the app. It's very simple to adjust, uses mostly sliders while you listen to audio. And once you are done it will create a setting that somehow manages to be far superior than what's already available in the app. It just cleans up the sound so much more to your liking; the difference is bewildering. Ever since that point, I have not listened to music the same. Just when I thought I was getting bored of music, these revived that love to want to listen to everything again and also motivated me to listen to things I never did before. There is literally pre-Sennheiser and during-Sennheiser eras to me now and am curious to their wired headsets. One thing that will become super noticeable is its soundstage. It spreads the instruments to a degree where you can notice more of everything. Albeit, this can be discombobulating and bassheads might not like the lack of sharp precision but this isn't meant to be your average linear listening experience (the Accentum Plus offers this at a much lower price). To give an example: What is Life by George Harrison. I might prefer it on the more linear style I am used to but these can separate things to the point where it is also directional and you can feel like you are standing at a concert and George is directly in the middle of it all in front of you so it feels more real- similar to as if you are becoming conscious of your own breathing. And in midst of all the chaos, you can still clearly hear George's voice and you notice ALL of the instruments more. It first gave me goosebumps how much it changed the song. Some songs are designed to be ""linear"" which could possibly affect emotional type of songs negatively but from a musical perspective, my goodness it is incredible. Now I just go back to see what music I am used to that changes with these (hint: a lot). Electronic/hip-hop music perhaps is the exception but this gives such clarity to detail that it is still a great listen- one thing is for sure these headsets love when there is a band setup (Bjork, the Roots, Gorillaz, etc). Sound quality is the biggest reason you go for these.Comfort: I can go on for a while without my ears hurting or anything. Also these don't heat up much and has proper adjustability for bigger headsLook: I have the black with copper ring and they are absolutely gorgeous. I question the longevity of the cloth on the headstrap but it makes it more beautiful than it has any business being for a plastic headsetFeatures: ANC is better than I expected. It does its job, and though it might not lead in this category, the differences are so small compared to the competition. Also drowned out what I needed it to during plane trips. And hearthrough, although I have had better, they will more than suffice to the point where I rarely have any issues hearing people. The fact that it is good at both of these is amazing for value.Battery: they can go up to nearly 60 hours, especially in standard mode. Not an exaggeration. I can go days without charging them. For this quality of headset, I don't think much of the competition comes close to this. In fact this is the mind blowing part because most other bluetooth headsets don't sound anywhere as good as these and they have half the battery life if not worse. No fears when travelling that it will die on me. In fact, it lasted me an entire week's tripSurprisesGaming: it has low enough latency. Combine that with that very clean audio and surprising directional audio this already has and wow, it performs quite well. I can actually spot details better and sometimes extra details I wasn't aware like I remember distinctly many months ago when I played Paladins, not only was I able to hear behind a wall slightly above me, but I realized it was subtle high heel sounds. I am not saying this will replace top of the line gaming headsets like steel series but if you have these and not a gaming headset, these will more than suffice.Charging: I was already enamored by the battery life but the fact is, it handles charging nearly as well. You can get hours worth per 10 minutes of charging and around an hour and a half or so it will be fully charged. That may not sound great but half of that will net you 30 hours of life which is STILL more than the competition. And the other surprise was that I accidentally discovered on the PC that you can still use it while charging - it simply appears as a different sound output you have to switch to. I thought it was weird how multiple momentum 4's appeared but when I clicked the other output, music started booming through it again. I was shocked. It already has a super long battery life with quick charging. It doesn't need it yet it has it. I have never had a headset that allows that with USB-C. Sennheiser were practically showing off at this point. So I would get a super long cable to make this comfortable during charging if you think this is a feature you will be usingThese are already the greatest -bluetooth- headsets I have ever owned under the $500 mark. I have tried out direct competitors Airpods Max (best hearthrough and good clean quality) and Sony Xm5's (amazing features and stylish) but the M4 felt like a no brainer. The max have poor battery life (under 20 hours) meanwhile these can reach close to triple that. The XM5's are light and so smooth with their features and touchpad (I loved speak to chat) but their fragility comes into question as they are notorious for the hinges breaking no matter how good you take care of them while the M4's mostly have earpads wearing down (easily replaceable). Meanwhile, guess what? The M4's imo sound better than both of them, are more comfortable than both, and can be found MUCH cheaper than both as I have seen it as low as $190. Even if, say, the Bowers & Wilkins PX8 might have slightly better audio and a better build, it's not a major difference so it is imo horrifically overpriced while this just has much higher value after sales and is an easier recommendationOverall, it absolutely bothers me just how overrated the other headsets on Amazon usually are meanwhile these get a bad impression. If you are a fan of music and you want to improve that experience with the bluetooth format at great affordability, it doesn't get better than theseRead more"

It was very easy to connect through bluetooth, the sound clarity on various tyes of music and podcasts are top notch.  I like that there are also specific buttons on the ear pieces so I can raise or lower volume, skip ahead, or take a call.  They're very comfortable and I don't get the constant usage itchiness from having something in my ear canal.  it clips onto my ear very easily with little broadcast ""speakers"" sitting outside my ear, they fit nicely and haven't moved to matter how much I may sweat.  i couldn't tell you the battery life yet but I've used them now for 3 days and as I take them out of the charging case they're still full of power.

They stay charged for ages, work at a great distance. My only critical feedback is that the mic quality isn't the greatest? But it's also def not the worst. If you want to record some pretty sounding audio, you're probably going to want an actual mic. Sometimes when calls come in to my earbuds, the caller can't always hear me. For me, I don't care, I didn't really want to talk to anyone anyway. Just wanted a soundtrack for punching & kicking & flipping around. Words are overrated.Once in awhile they fall out, and I figure that's my fault, cos I didn't swap out the little ear-plug doodlebobber. Mid-review, I did that (sized up with the one larger size they provided), just to see if it was better. I whipped my head around feverishly. Yeah, it seems better. Big ol ear holes, evidently; no wonder the world's too loud. Guess they get 4.5 stars now. But gonna round down not up cos screw the Man, amirite? jk Rounding up cos I don't know if these guys are the Man, when they're furnishing the proles with budget airbuds as a work around to Apple's walled garden / utopian prison camp. Maybe this act of working class solidarity deserves an extra half star, even if no one can hear me. What did I really have to say, anyway, that hasn't already been said by someone, somewhere, at this point? How important are all these little thoughts in my head that they need a microphone? If it really matters, maybe I'll just go in person.Um, yeah, great headphones. 9/10. Would buy again.Read more"
"Skullcandy Crusher ANC 2 Wireless Over-Ear Bluetooth Headphones with Multi-Sensory Bass and Charging Cable, Active Noise Cancelling, Up to 60 Hours Battery, Microphone for iPhone Android - True Black",$123.49,4.7 out of 5 stars,"1,863","I initially had the Crusher ANC and had been using them for about 3 years now. I realized that they weren‚Äôt picking up the 25-40hz bass range too well. I know it‚Äôs headphones, I shouldn‚Äôt expect $1000 car audio quality from headphones, I figured though, if these can get to the mid 40s range, maybe there‚Äôs some headphones out there that CAN do a little better job picking up that 25-40 range better than these (SN, I‚Äôm an audiophile and have the ears of an audio engineer, so I want my music to always sound great and these are for the gym). A lot of the music I listen to has bass in that range. So I do my research and to my surprise, Skull Candy released the ANC 2, so I did more research and found the frequency response as low as 20hz, I‚Äôm like ok, I know it‚Äôs not going to flawlessly get down to 20hz, let‚Äôs try them out though. While they don‚Äôt play below 30hz in a fantastic manner, FOR HEADPHONES UNDER $200, they catch 20-30hz about as well as they‚Äôre going to. Most of my library doesn‚Äôt get below 30hz, so I‚Äôm a happy camper. The highs and lows are so crisp and clear and the bass is even smoother on these than the ANC. It sounds like HIGH END aftermarket truck subs! If you know anything about that, truck subs have a tighter and cleaner thump to them. I‚Äôm a fan of these headphones!Read more"
"PHILIPS H6509 Wireless Headphones,Over-Ear Bluetooth Headphones with Noise Canceling Pro,Dynamic Bass,70H Battery Life,Fast Charging,Soft Ear Cups,Bluetooth 5.3, Multipoint Connectivity,App Control",$49.99,4.2 out of 5 stars,856,"First off, it's important to note that these headphones fill a niche: somebody who wants an over-ear style closed-back headset that has some degree of water/dust resistance (in this case, IP55). They probably shouldn't be the only pair of headphones you own and use. These are ideal for exercise (since they can handle sweat) or anywhere they might get hit with drops of rain or sand. You can even use them in the bathtub without worry of splashing on them (unlike most other over-ear sets), but be very careful not to submerge or drop them in the water.If you don't need the water resistance, you can find better audio quality and comfort. For home listening, I'd suggest springing a bit more for a comfortable open-back headset set, and for casual listening outside the house, high quality earbuds (which I'd also suggest springing a bit more for) are still ideal. However, my problem with earbuds is that when exercising, my ear canals tend to tighten up and they become extremely uncomfortable. This set is built to stay on your head while exercising, so it can feel a bit tight after a couple hours, but the earpads have a soft ""cooling gel"" that is better than other sets I've used, and it definitely gets more comfortable after a short break-in period. As an added bonus, the pads are removable and the outer lining is washable (although they feel pretty durable, I'm curious to see how long they last). The headband has a strip of rubber to soften the pressure, but it does feel a bit too hard and some comfort improvements could be made there. On the other hand, it feels built like a tank - they're light on your head, but still feel extremely durable. Other bonuses include a standard audio jack as an option instead of Bluetooth, big sturdy volume control buttons that aren't a pain to use like most headset controls, and an insane battery that lasts ages (I got at least the manufacturer spec of 35 hours, using them 2-3 hours a day for nearly two weeks without needing to recharge).These weren't the first pair of water-resistant cans I bought from Phillips. The previous version was the SH402, which I bought based on goodwill coming from their excellent X2 headphones I've used for years. These were an absolute travesty, with buzzing out of one side and audio quality that sounded like somebody playing music under a couch in the next room with the door closed, and I'd never returned something so fast. The A4216 set VASTLY improves on these, with very good audio quality. It's still not top-tier in the pure audio department or anything - it's a bit overly bassy with a hint of a muffled quality in the way a lot of closed-back headsets that are built to prevent audio leakage are - but it's more than good enough as a minor compromise to balance out the other benefits this set has (especially for the reasonable price), and again, if you don't need an exercise/water-resistant headset, you'd probably want to look elsewhere anyway. If you happen to be in that particular market though, I'm not sure you can really do much better than these.Read more"

"Sennheiser MOMENTUM 4 Wireless Headphones, Bluetooth for Crystal-Clear Calls w/Adaptive Noise Cancellation, 60h Battery Life, Customizable Sound & Lightweight Folding Design, Graphite",$265.95,4.0 out of 5 stars,"7,609","5 stars to me. 4 stars all around for the average consumer due to issues I believe others will find a problem with but I have found some workarounds forI will start off with the flaws (unfortunately it has em) from my experience and some solutions. They are mostly features based. I'll also address confusions and ""negative"" experiences as there are reviews where clearly it's the people and not the headphones that are the problem yet they are giving this a worse impression that it should have. And lastly praise what it has going well for itAlso, I will highly suggest downloading the new app version called smart control PLUS and install any firmware updates. Then go adjust settings or it will have some annoyances.FlawsOn-head detection: this causes most of the headaches. For those that like to free up an ear to listen to someone talk better - make a habit of freeing your left ear and not the right. There is a sensor to detect your ear and it is only INSIDE the right earcup.  It makes a double click noise when it detects and stops detecting your ear. Unfortunately it makes a similar sound for both which is a huge flaw as you might not know if it is detecting or not sometimes. This will trigger the auto off feature if it doesn't detect you while you're listening to music. It usually pauses from the headset, but there is a possibility it can be ignored by an app and continue playing so when you put it back on you might not even know if it detected you. Another possibility is you made the mistake of pressing play from the app itself when it stops detecting you thus eventually triggering the sleep feature. You can disable auto off but I personally put it in 1 hour just in case as I would have likely readjusted my headset by that point and reset it. This goes into the next feature: auto play. It's perfectly fine on mobile but on PC it can be a nightmare as you could be listening to music, you adjust your right earcup so it pauses and when you put it back on, it might play some other video like youtube in an open browser; it depends on the programs that behave to bluetooth pause/play. So don't have so many open video/audio programs in the background. Also for those with long hair, autoplay can struggle to detect if it completely covers your right ear (some people start to think it stopped working). Overall, I just disabled autoplay while keeping auto-off enabled as I mainly use the M4 on PC, but again, it seems to work really well on mobile. Plus of course if any of these aren't necessary to you, you can simply disable it as a whole for an old fashioned headphone experience to avoid annoyances but I have gotten used to it at this point that I rarely have issues [Update: I just learned on May 2025 that as of the new firmware 2.13.42 it reads ""Improved auto-off behavior reducing unexpected behavior during calls or streaming due to misdetection in smart pause sensor"", so perhaps this section might become untrue with less flaws down the road thus hopefully improving user experience]Multi- point connection: It can and will connect to two devices that have bluetooth active after they have been paired.

To be honest, I would skip everything and go straight for the sound personalization feature in the app. It's very simple to adjust, uses mostly sliders while you listen to audio. And once you are done it will create a setting that somehow manages to be far superior than what's already available in the app. It just cleans up the sound so much more to your liking; the difference is bewildering. Ever since that point, I have not listened to music the same. Just when I thought I was getting bored of music, these revived that love to want to listen to everything again and also motivated me to listen to things I never did before. There is literally pre-Sennheiser and during-Sennheiser eras to me now and am curious to their wired headsets. One thing that will become super noticeable is its soundstage. It spreads the instruments to a degree where you can notice more of everything. Albeit, this can be discombobulating and bassheads might not like the lack of sharp precision but this isn't meant to be your average linear listening experience (the Accentum Plus offers this at a much lower price). To give an example: What is Life by George Harrison. I might prefer it on the more linear style I am used to but these can separate things to the point where it is also directional and you can feel like you are standing at a concert and George is directly in the middle of it all in front of you so it feels more real- similar to as if you are becoming conscious of your own breathing. And in midst of all the chaos, you can still clearly hear George's voice and you notice ALL of the instruments more. It first gave me goosebumps how much it changed the song. Some songs are designed to be ""linear"" which could possibly affect emotional type of songs negatively but from a musical perspective, my goodness it is incredible. Now I just go back to see what music I am used to that changes with these (hint: a lot). Electronic/hip-hop music perhaps is the exception but this gives such clarity to detail that it is still a great listen- one thing is for sure these headsets love when there is a band setup (Bjork, the Roots, Gorillaz, etc). Sound quality is the biggest reason you go for these.Comfort: I can go on for a while without my ears hurting or anything. Also these don't heat up much and has proper adjustability for bigger headsLook: I have the black with copper ring and they are absolutely gorgeous. I question the longevity of the cloth on the headstrap but it makes it more beautiful than it has any business being for a plastic headsetFeatures: ANC is better than I expected. It does its job, and though it might not lead in this category, the differences are so small compared to the competition. Also drowned out what I needed it to during plane trips. And hearthrough, although I have had better, they will more than suffice to the point where I rarely have any issues hearing people. The fact that it is good at both of these is amazing for value.Battery: they can go up to nearly 60 hours, especially in standard mode. Not an exaggeration. I can go days without charging them. For this quality of headset, I don't think much of the competition comes close to this. In fact this is the mind blowing part because most other bluetooth headsets don't sound anywhere as good as these and they have half the battery life if not worse. No fears when travelling that it will die on me. In fact, it lasted me an entire week's tripSurprisesGaming: it has low enough latency. Combine that with that very clean audio and surprising directional audio this already has and wow, it performs quite well. I can actually spot details better and sometimes extra details I wasn't aware like I remember distinctly many months ago when I played Paladins, not only was I able to hear behind a wall slightly above me, but I realized it was subtle high heel sounds. I am not saying this will replace top of the line gaming headsets like steel series but if you have these and not a gaming headset, these will more than suffice.Charging: I was already enamored by the battery life but the fact is, it handles charging nearly as well. You can get hours worth per 10 minutes of charging and around an hour and a half or so it will be fully charged. That may not sound great but half of that will net you 30 hours of life which is STILL more than the competition. And the other surprise was that I accidentally discovered on the PC that you can still use it while charging - it simply appears as a different sound output you have to switch to. I thought it was weird how multiple momentum 4's appeared but when I clicked the other output, music started booming through it again. I was shocked. It already has a super long battery life with quick charging. It doesn't need it yet it has it. I have never had a headset that allows that with USB-C. Sennheiser were practically showing off at this point. So I would get a super long cable to make this comfortable during charging if you think this is a feature you will be usingThese are already the greatest -bluetooth- headsets I have ever owned under the $500 mark. I have tried out direct competitors Airpods Max (best hearthrough and good clean quality) and Sony Xm5's (amazing features and stylish) but the M4 felt like a no brainer. The max have poor battery life (under 20 hours) meanwhile these can reach close to triple that. The XM5's are light and so smooth with their features and touchpad (I loved speak to chat) but their fragility comes into question as they are notorious for the hinges breaking no matter how good you take care of them while the M4's mostly have earpads wearing down (easily replaceable). Meanwhile, guess what? The M4's imo sound better than both of them, are more comfortable than both, and can be found MUCH cheaper than both as I have seen it as low as $190. Even if, say, the Bowers & Wilkins PX8 might have slightly better audio and a better build, it's not a major difference so it is imo horrifically overpriced while this just has much higher value after sales and is an easier recommendationOverall, it absolutely bothers me just how overrated the other headsets on Amazon usually are meanwhile these get a bad impression. If you are a fan of music and you want to improve that experience with the bluetooth format at great affordability, it doesn't get better than theseRead more"
"Wireless Earbuds 75hrs Bluetooth 5.4 Headphone Sport, 2025 Bluetooth Earbuds Stereo Deep Bass Over Ear Bud with Earhooks, ENC Noise Cancelling Mic, IPX7 Waterproof Earphone for Workout/Running",$25.99,4.3 out of 5 stars,"16,597","i love these! i had a purple pair, but unfortunately, someone had stolen them recently. so, I bought a new pair being I liked them so much. they def don't fall out of my ears like other earbuds do. the bass and sound quality is wonderful. they're definitely loud, so if you're phone (or other devices you may use them with) is like mine and has nice bass already, you're in for a treat. I've had earbuds that made my head and brain feel like they were vibrating, I'm not a fan of that feeling really, so I love that these ones don't do that but have the great bass still. I love the fact that they have a button so that just a small tap won't pause or change anything when you don't want it to. even for phone calls, YouTube videos, and tiktok these are great! mine came in with a battery charge of 100% as well, so you should be able to use them right away. the purple pair that had gotten stolen had come in with a 97% charge, too. they do come with a charger but no USB block, which I don't feel like it's an issue. I'm sure we all have a block for that laying around or we could use a desktop or laptop to charge them. the color is very pretty, too! i was expecting more of a purple tone to it since I ordered purple blue this time, but they're more blue. still gorgeous! I'm definitely going to be ordering more, though. i want the light green ones, too! I love all the different color options! and they're all such pretty colors. the purple ones were so bright, I do miss those ones! but I adore these ones for sure! the little screens in the case have never never lagged for me, either. you'll see when the charge is decreasing and it does alert you when it's low immediately. the screen on the right does show what is pictured and will let you know if they're unevenly charged, which sometimes I only use one earbud, so that's great to know septhow much of a charge they have. they're definitely worth the price and I do recommend them! packaging is safe and secure for them as well! there is a film to pull off that protects the case when you unbox it as well. and they do come with a little bag of rubber ear pieces of different sizes, which is also awesome! i believe there's 2-3 different sized ones in the little bag. soooo 10/10 definitely recommend!Read more"

I use them every day, and they‚Äôve become such a coveted item that my son tries to take mine, so I got him a pair. His is blue and mine is black and gold. He already had his headphones, and when mine showed up, a little tug-of-war ensued, but I won.The headphones paired easily with my cell phone, laptop, and television. While I only use one device at a time (not multiple connections), the pairing process was quick and seamless. When paired with my TV, the connection has always been stable‚Äîunless I walk out of range. For example, if I‚Äôm watching TV in the living room and then walk to the garage, the sound may become spotty due to the number of walls in between. It‚Äôs expected with Bluetooth.For me, the sound quality is excellent. I‚Äôve never had any issues with audio dropouts, and I‚Äôm especially impressed with the stereo reception. For the price I paid, these headphones are worth it.I‚Äôve purchased this brand a few times before because of its solid balance of quality and affordability.

"Nothing Ear (a) Wireless Earbuds with ChatGPT Integration, 45dB Hybrid Noise Cancelling Earbuds, Hi-Res Audio, Advanced Equaliser, Dual Connect, 6 Mics,42.5H Playtime Ear buds Wireless Bluetooth Black",$69.00,4.2 out of 5 stars,"3,681","Great Bluetooth earphones! If you are looking for comfortable fit, great sound quality, and good mic for calls this is the pair for you.I have had my eyes on these earphones for a while and bought them when they were one sale. Totally worth it!The quality of these are great. They sound great right out of the box, hardly had to mess with any of the EQ settings in the app. So it was surprising just how well everything sounded once I started using them.More Thoughts:I'm not a professional audio reviewer or hardcore audiophile, so this is just coming from an high quality audio enjoyer. I will also have some comparisons to the Jabra Elite 7 Pros that I've used.Sound Quality:I really love the sound of the Nothing Earphones, music sounds bass-y and punchy, if you listen to rock or music with a deeper or more intense sound, these handle that great. I listen to a lot of different genres and all of them sound really clear and balanced without touching the EQ settings. I haven't messed with them a lot myself but you have a couple presets and the ability to set your own. Personally I haven't felt the need to since the sound is so high quality and clear to start with. If you like to listen to your music loud they handle them easily without making your ears or head hurt. Definitely my favorite sounding pair of earphones I have experienced.Mic quality:I used a pair of Jabra Elite 7 Pros for over 2 years as my daily earphones for music and videos that were priced at $140 USD when I first purchased them that were great but after two years they needed an upgrade. A complaint I always had with the Jabras was the mic quality for calls, my voice was always too low or muffled, but with the Nothing earphones my voice is so much clearer and I have even had people comment how loud I sound using them! So they are great for calls. On the receiving end voice you are are really clear with hardly any background noise coming through.ANC (Active Noise Canceling):The ANC on the Nothing Earphones are fantastic. In the app there are a few different options: low, medium, high, and adaptive. The default is high, and it makes it feel like you are in your own world. Once you are playing music or a video almost all the outside noise disappears. I work in an office at a marine so sometimes voices or heavy machinery comes through but at such a low volume you hardly register it. Though I might have to give the edge to my Jabras with just how much more consistent the ANC is on them especially when you have a good fit. Great ANC but not best out there.Transparency:The transparency mode is not as good as the Jabra, I find that any music you may be playing can drown out any noise or voices you want to come through. It, in my opinion, doesn't let enough sounds through when you are at medium volume or louder especially if you find yourself talking a lot with them in. So if what you are playing isn't too loud its fine.Controls/Buttons:The buttons on the stems of the earphones function off of pinches, it is not your typical press or touch buttons. It takes a bit to get used to especially if you are used to a tactile press button like on Jabra products. But the accuracy of the pinches/controls is great. I haven't had it do something I didn't intended. Also the range of custom options for the buttons is great with you being able to change them to whatever scheme you want. The only thing you can't change is the Play/pause button. But I was happy to be able to change the buttons functions to what I needed them to be, which a bit more than I could say for the Jabras.Fit:The ear tips that the Nothing earphones come with are very comfortable and fit really nicely. I typically use the smallest tips that an earphone comes with, anything bigger usually falls out or pushes itself out of my ear, but the medium size that comes on them fit surprisingly great for me. I did switch to the smaller ones for comfort but I can't complain about the larger size. You get three sizes with these earphones: small, medium, and large. The material feels really nice in the ear  as well. And the overall shape of the earphones feels great in the ear, just sits comfortable inside, sometimes I can forget they are even there, and the stems are no bother.Battery/Charging:The case and the earphones charge really fast and the indicator light on the case is nice way to tell the charge level. They come with a very short usb-c to usb-c cable that charges the case so quickly, especially with the right adapter. Charge much faster than the Jabra case and earphones. The battery life on the Nothing earphones is pretty great for 8 hour work days. And the case charge lasts me an entire week or more. If you are using the ANC or Transparency modes it does tank the life quite a bit, as with most earphones. The most I have had them last while using ANC on High nonstop is about 5 hours, which to me is pretty good. And once you put them in the case to charge you can definitely get an entire day out of them using ANC. Without ANC you can go through most of a day, maybe 10-12 hours or more of use. My jabras perform quite identically but the charge on them doesn't last as long after in the case for 10 minutes.Conclusion:There are probably things I've missed or things other people notice, but to the average person these earphones come at a great price and provide you with insanely great quality across the board. The mic alone makes this a worth while purchase. But the sound is smooth, crispy, and clear when you need it to be. My favorite set of earphones I've bought myself so far. They are definitely my go to daily drivers.Read more"

Took 1-2 hours to charge and have been working for about 3 with no problems. The range is about 40' from my phone, not quite from end to end in my house but easily into the next room. Everything was packaged well and all components came as advertised. They are comfortable to wear and do not show with my hair down. Even with my hair up, they would be discreet. Because of the design, they stay on well, even when changing clothes and being active. I like my earbuds better for sound quality, but these let me have conversations and hear noises around me. Another bonus is that I have moderate hearing loss in one ear because of the bone conduction feature, I can hear fairly equally in both ears. For now, 5 stars, I will update if they are not durable enough or waterproof.Read more"

Nonetheless the sound quality is amazing with tooooons of bass. These are advertised as over the ear but are kind of over, kind of on. I can't stand the sound and feeling of on ear headphones but these feel really good actually. The EQ settings are pretty useless. One is clear with great bass, the other has a lot of mid, and the other is just flat. Skip em and keep it on ""voice"" setting. Comes with a 3.5mm cable and USB-C charging cable. The color is ok, kind of yellow, kind of pinkish. A little bulky out of the corner of my eye. The fold up really nicely.

The sound is crisp and amazing bass, and makes music sound the way it was made.However, for Amazon customer service 1 star!  Placed the order for the spring deal along with other items all in which were being delivered together in the same shipping box. However, when the shipment arrived all items were included except they forgot to box the ear buds. Called to let them know about the missing item in which they told me they would have to investigate and that process could take up to 5 days. So no refund or no replacement I would have to re-order the ear buds in which I did and am I glad I did. NOW, for Amazon you guys really need to improve your service in regards to handling matters such as mine. First, the investigation I'm fine with and understand perfectly it needs to get done to prevent fraud from consumers. Talking with the first person when I called I wanted to make sure about the investigation process being done because it was a simple one at that. All that had to be done was see the time that the delivery label was printed shortly before that time you would clearly be able to see the person packing my items, and see only 3 out of the 4 items were placed in the box. Case closed! I do not appreciate having to call to check on the status and everything agents were rude and could not answer simple questions I still had about the investigation process. Now, after 4 days I called again to see the status of the investigation, for the operator to say we are issuing a refund. Why, did I not get a phone call or email letting me know about the result. Why is it me having to take time out of my day again to find out the status for a mistake your company clearly did while shipping my items. All, I was asking for is basic customer service admitting you were wrong and the very least an apology. I do not appreciate having to waste my time after not receiving an item I purchased having to go through this type of treatment. I really do not appreciate as if I was wrong and trying to commit fraud making a false claim. If this is the type of service that is consistently given, I will in the future spend more money and give my business to a company that shows appreciation.Read more"

"Sony ZX Series Wired On-Ear Headphones, White MDR-ZX110",,4.5 out of 5 stars,"108,288","IN SHORT> Great for the price. Very good sound quality. Very well designed.  Comfortable.COMPARED TO EARBUDS> For most uses, mostly listening to audiobooks, I use Panasonic ErgoFit earbuds-HJE120K or Sony MDR-EX15LP earbuds. In comparison, I was blown away with the much greater base response of the Sony ZX headphones -- even though I was expecting the fuller base (which indeed was my reason for buying the Sony XZ headphones to replace a pair of Sony headphones which were falling apart after 20 years of use). The greater dynamic range adds a dimension to most music, even for music which has little base.> GIVE THEM A CHANCE -- My first impression was poor -- they sounded muddy. Then I remembered that I've had similar first impressions of some other new headphones. It takes a while, maybe 12 hours of use, to ""break in"" some earphones or headphones (and/or there may be some rewiring going on inside your cranium, i.e., ""learning"").  So, don't be misled by immediate reactions posted by some other reviewers --- nor your own first impression.> After 12 hours of use (and now, about a year later), the mid-tones are still a little muddy, at least to my aging ears, in the music I listen to (Enya, folk, classical)--- a little smothered by the base. I need to reduce the base by using a graphic equalizer (such as in Windows Media Player, or built into some devices) for almost any music to sound best to me---but that's generally true of high quality earphones. That is, audiophile headphones have a ""flat response""---meaning that they reproduce what was recorded, as is was recorded, without emphasizing the base, midtones, nor high notes. For listening, adjustment is often necessary. If you've never used an equalizer, you'll be stunned by the difference that slight adjustments can make.FOLDABLE> Folds flat (to about 1"" thick X 4"" X 6""). Some other foldable headphones fold into balls, which are not easily carried in a pocket.CORD> The cord is 4' and a few inches long. For me, that is long enough to reach my computer audio plug (but, I added a 1' extension to make it easier). However, in my opinion, the cord is much too long to connect to a cell phone, etc. in your pocket. I'd prefer that the cord plugged into the headphones, so that I could simply purchase cords of the appropriate length.> ASIDE --- if the sound is scratchy when you move the plug, or otherwise suddenly deteriorates, the problem may be a bad connection.  A tiny bit of cheap silicon grease, well spread, can do wonders to improve any electrical connections---particularly low voltage connections---anything battery or USB powered.> The plug is L-shaped, angled at 90 degrees, unfortunately. That means that it won't ""cleanly"" connect to an extension. If you pull on the cord, you won't easily pull it out the socket, but you will put on strain on the cord where the plug attaches, and potential damage the cord. In my experience, this is how most headphones fail. So, I consider the angled plug a negative feature, and another reason that replaceable cords are desirable.  {{Well, actually, my Senegal parrot is the main cause of failure of my earbuds and headphones, but that's a different story.}}CUSHIONS AND COMFORT> The cushions do not look impressive nor luxurious -- but they are very functional.  They are quite comfortable --- essentially unnoticeable -- and they easily stay in place for many hours of listening.  The ""crinkled-tissue"" surface material and the flat design help grip the ears lightly without concentrating pressure. In comparison, I've used other headphones with cushions which, least at first, gave the impression of greater luxury --- but, I remember some headphones which would not stay in place, and gave me sore ears after a half-hour or so. Not the Sony ZX headphones, they stay in place and I can wear them all day long without getting sore ears.> The tightness is not adjustable, so the Sony ZX headphones might be loose on small heads.> How you wear the headset can make a difference on the quality of the sound.  Although that's probably dependent on the size and shape of your ears.  For me, if I pull the ""legs"" out a little, so that the headset is barely touching the top of my head, and the earphones are angled a little bit upward into my ears, the sound is best.  I use black gaffer's tape to hold the legs at my preferred adjustment.  I suspect that wearing the headset this way that I'm getting more ""bone conduction"" and therefore richer undertones.> Part of the comfort equation is that the whole headset is very light ‚Äì it‚Äôs not going to press down painfully on the top of your head.  You won‚Äôt have to adjust the tightness too tight (IF you could adjust the tightness) to hold the headphones in place.CAVEAT> (Apparently obligatory if you want to be taken seriously) ""Of course, more expensive headphones, deliver higher (audiophile) quality."" Yeh, sure. In an era when almost everyone is listening to highly compressed mp3, or even more compressed streamed music.  I doubt that more than 1 in 100 people, maybe 1 in 1000, can tell the difference between these headphones and ""audiophile"" headphones --- and even then, only when listening to high-quality uncompressed recordings.  But where are you going to find uncompressed recordings? -- audio CDs are practically extinct (not to mention that vinyl freaks complain that audio CDs are over-compressed).  SUGGESTION -- If you've got a CD player, listen to a well-mastered recording, and then try listening to the highly-compressed streamed-crap version of the same music.> RECOMMENDATIONS> For most people, instead of fretting about audio quality, consider other features which may be important to you, such as a plug-in cord, wi-fi, adjustable headband tension, noise cancellation, etc. I'm not saying that you need these features --- I'm just saying that IF you do, then they may be valid reasons to look at other brands and models. If looking at other models, don't forget to consider foldability, and ear cushion comfort.> If you just want good sound (for music) at a good price, you can stop here. For voice (telephone conversations, audiobooks, podcasts, etc.) or when using a battery-powered device, I recommend considering earbuds instead. Sony MDR-EX15LP earbuds are cleaner, clearer and crisper in the voice-range, without fiddling with an equalizer.  The Sony MDR-EX15LP earbuds (or Panasonic Ergofit) also provide better isolation (you hear less of the ambient noise around you).  Also, the earbuds draw much less juice -- that is, your battery will last MUCH longer.ASIDE---WHY?> There is a direct relationship between the size of a speaker and the sound waves it can best produce. Decades ago, even in home systems, base speakers (woofers) were 2 feet in diameter. Tweaters 1 1/2 inches across were used for high notes, with various size speakers in between for mid-ranges. It is extraordinary that headphones can reproduce base at all, and an engineering miracle that earbuds can produce even a hint of base. But still, the underlying physics remains. So, most audiophiles will insist on 50mm ""drivers"" in headsets --- the Sony ZX driver are nominally 35mm diameter -- much smaller.  But ""big drivers"" means bigger, much heavier, magnets -- so you have to wear the headphones tighter, and therefore get sore ears.  Google it -- there are dozens of websites about how to cope with ""headphone ear pain"" -- but the best solution, for most people, is to wear lighter headphones, such as Sony ZX headphones.> Also (grossly over simplifying), different frequencies of sound interfere with each other, especially on the cone (or emitting surface) of speaker.  In fact, on multiple speaker setups (with tweeters, midtone speakers, woofers, and sometimes subwoofers), frequencies outside the optimal range for the particular speaker are filtered out before they get to the speaker -- so the mid-tone speaker does not get high frequency signals nor base signals.  So, if a speaker (such as an earbud) inherently has a minimal base response, the mid-tones will be cleaner and clearer.  If you object, ""I hear base on my earbuds"" --- well sorta, but that's a magnified base with little detail, and never the undertones that you feel more than hear.  So (all other things being equal -- which is never the case): earbuds for voice, headphones for music, headphones with large drivers for audiophile quality sound (if you can tolerate the sore ears). In real life, it isn't so clear.> Keep in mind that, for most people, headphones are ""bling"" --- a fashion accessory, where prestige is the most important consideration, and the headphones are priced accordingly.  The sound quality, comfort, etc. of ""fashionable headphones"" is often a secondary, or tertiary, consideration.  Sony ZX headphones make the statement that, ""I am a practical person who doesn't care about fashion"".  If that describes you, and music quality is important to you, and the mix of features fit your needs, then Sony ZX headphones are a an excellent choice for you among headphones priced under $200, and Sony ZX probably delivers higher audio quality than many $200 headphones.> SONY -- In my limited experience, Sony design and execution is uniformly top notch.  Not the fad-of-the-moment feature in every model---but a good balance of features in every model.  Not the best possible at ANY cost --- but rather, the best quality at the target price -- and often (or usually) very competitive with much more expensive products from other brands.  Not necessarily ""better"" than another brand or model --- because the mix of features, aesthetics, and personal preferences can matter. But, if I had to purchase an audio gift for someone (not knowing their exact preferences), or if I had to grab an audio product when running through an airport for my own use, it would be Sony every time.NOISE CANCELLATION> The Sony ZX headphones do NOT feature noise cancellation, and you  don't need it just for listening to music.  Beware also that so-called ""noise cancellation"" means at least four different things.  ""Noise cancellation"" is mostly a highly-abused ""buzz word"" which is used in advertising copy --- usually deceptively.> The ""noise cancellation"" touted for most earbuds is really just passive isolation -- which the Sony MDR-EX15LP earbuds (or Panasonic Ergofit,  etc) provide.  The wifi earbuds for Apple and Samsung phones etc (round balls on sticks, without the cup-shaped rubber cushions) do NOT provide significant passive isolation.--> The Sony ZX headphones provide little passive isolation.  Some other brands and models are better, but at the ""price"" of large heavy cup-shaped cushions which enclose your entire ear.> The ""noise cancellation"" touted for those ""round balls on sticks"" wifi earbuds, is really anti-feedback circuitry -- which is necessary only because the microphone and the speaker are not significantly separated -- but otherwise, the circuitry  provides little, if any, noise cancellation.  If you have earbuds with good passive isolation, and the microphone is several inches away from the earbuds (always the case with wired earbuds), you don't need (and won't get) anti-feedback circuitry.> The ""noise cancellation"" touted for many headsets is really the addition of ""white noise"" on top of the ambient noise, and on top of whatever it is that you want to listen to.  This is cheap and actually works fairly well (about half as good you'd like it to work), when combined with passive isolation,  in noisy environments.  I use such a set for air travel.  But, in my experience,  it gives me a sick headache after a few hours.> True ""noise cancellation"", more fully called ""active noise cancellation"" is  limited, and is usually very expensive.  It is good for low frequency constant or repetitive noise, such as aircraft engines, but is of no help at all for screaming children or other random noises.  Caveat, just because the advertising copy claims ""active noise cancellation"", does not mean that you actually get ""active noise cancellation"".  It's kinda like ""organic strawberries"" from South America.  No-one is enforcing ""organic"" standards for foreign produce.  With electronics, it comes down to trusting the brandname.  Especially in electronics, there are very few brandnames that are trustworthy anymore.  To the best of my knowledge, Sony is one of the few trustworthy brandnames left.Read more"

"JBL Live 770NC - Wireless Over-Ear Headphones with True Adaptive Noise Cancelling with Smart Ambient, Up to 65 Hours of Battery Life, Comfort-fit Fabric Headband & Carrying Pouch (Sandstone)",,4.5 out of 5 stars,"1,032","(This is a fairly long review. If you want to read only about a certain aspect, I have this review broken down into different paragraphs. At the very end is a simple PRO-CON list.)Let me start by saying that I've never spent more than $30 on headphones before. In fact, I actually still have one of my old pairs, and the difference is night and day. So that is what I was used to. I've had these JBL 770NC headphones for five, almost six months now, and I absolutely love them! Are they perfect? Almost, but nothing on earth really is. Anyway, here is how it started: I've only ever had your average $25 headphones, and never spent the money on anything special. Soon, however, those headphones started to seem less appealing to me; the battery life was declining and the listening experience got worse over long periods of time. The band even started to look like it was going to break. Back when I had first gotten them, I didn't even know of JBL, but about the time I was considering new headphones I had gotten the JBL Charge 5 (I have another review of that one, if you are interested), and since I was impressed with that speaker, I wanted to see how they were with headphones. I started looking for the perfect headphones from them, that combined noise canceling with sound quality. I almost got the 660NC, but then I learned about the 770NC, which was very new at the time. I decided to indulge, and oh boy, it was worth it! When I got the headphones I decided to listen to music on my old pair first, then the new ones so I could compare better. Let me tell you, I could almost hear the ""woosh!"" of silence as I turned on the JBL headphones for the first time... Below I have a detailed review of each aspect of these headphones:DESIGN: 8 / 10: Great! I appreciate the design of these headphones better than the others I have had. The main controls are on the right ear, including the volume +, -, multi-functional button(pause, play, skip, replay) and mode button. There is also a touch control on the right side, and the actual touch-sensing part is where it says JBL. The touch control seemed annoying at first, with accidentally pausing and the like, but over time, I got used to it, and now I see it as super convenient! You tap it once to pause, twice to skip, three times to replay, and you can even answer incoming calls by simply tapping it twice. The power slider is also on the right side (yes, I said slider). The power on and off is not a button, but a slider. You simply slide it up and it will slide back down and power on. Same thing to turn them off. You can also turn them off via the app. Another thing is that these headphones do feel fragile, however, and I wouldn't toss them around or be rough with them. But through my frequent use over the months, these headphones have held up well.COMFORT: 10 / 10: Amazing! I absolutely find these comfortable, and they are the most comfortable headphones I have ever had! The band itself is covered in a soft fabric, unlike my other headphones which had plastic. In addition, I have never had over-ear headphones (in case you didn't know, these are over-ear, which simply means that the cups go over your ears), and even that part was amazingly comfortable. The cups gently, but securely fit over my ears. In fact, I have used these headphones for watching TV on my projector, and after a few minutes I actually had forgotten that I was even wearing headphones! That says a lot.SOUND QUALITY: 10 / 10: Stunning! As I said earlier, when I first tried these headphones I listened to music on my other pair first, and then tried the JBL. The difference was night and day! Clear, crisp audio that I didn't know was possible on headphones. Rich bass was also present, and there is even an option in the app that allows the bass to be higher at lower volumes. My experience with JBL sound quality continues to be great, and these headphones are no exception! When you power them on, you are greeted with a pleasant ""Power On"" voice, which is very clear. On other headphones I hear the same thing, but the quality of the audio is not near as crisp. The music is great! It is amazing! Even at low volumes it keeps the sound at great quality. Higher volumes continue this as well! Though I have never gone really high in volume, as I have never needed to. I keep getting blown away by JBL and their products. If you are interested in these headphones, believe me, the sound quality will rise above your expectations! (I'll even go out to say I'm not even interested in Bose headphones...)FEATURES (Noise canceling, ambient aware, etc.): 10 / 10: Amazing! I've NEVER had true, active noise canceling headphones before, so this feature shocked me with how good it was! Once you turn noise canceling(NC) on, every little sound disappears. Every...little...sound. Sometimes you don't even know how much noise is around you until you experience something like this. The headphones themselves, I think, block some sound (since it is over-ear), but the active noise canceling can make a world of difference! To not be able to hear anything but your music is stunning, and it was completely worth it! That said, I know there are a lot of you that are thinking to yourselves, ""Can I mow with these on and my music be free of engine noise? (Or blade noise since there are electric mowers)"" My answer to that question would be yes, to an extent. An understanding of how noise canceling works would help me explain (for those who have never truly experienced active noise canceling). ANC (active noise canceling) works by taking in sound from outside, say, a bird chirping, then producing the negative sound frequency, therefore canceling the sound. However, this doesn't entirely ""delete"" all sound. If you turn the feature on and do anything that produces a loud sound (keyword being loud), like slam a door, the sound will greatly be reduced, but you will likely still hear it (ever so quietly, though). But that is only if there is no music playing. If you turn music on as well, then other sounds become nearly nonexistent. Think of it like this, ANC on, but music off, you hear faint sound, that is, greatly reduced sound. ANC on, but music on as well, no outside sound. I hope that makes sense. Now, with REALLY loud sounds, like a mower, you are going to hear it if you are not playing music. However, once you start playing music, it will be much lower (not gone, but much lower). You are likely still going to hear the mower because it is so loud. But, if I turn the music slightly higher, then the mower becomes background noise (yes, I mow with these headphones on). Every increase in volume makes the mower that much more quiet. This makes the mower, or any other loud sound simply background noise. But again, this is really only true of LOUD sounds, as anything else is simply canceled out. In most cases, that is, when you are not mowing, all you hear is your music, and absolutely nothing else. If I'm honest, it was kind of freaky when I first tried it out. Ambient Aware is like a half-way point. It lets you listen to your music, letting a certain amount of background noise in. This works because the headphones themselves have a few microphones on them that can be used to ""let in"" background noise. How much noise you want to let in can be changed via the app. It works so that if you wanted to take a nature walk for example, but wanted to listen to both your music and outside sounds, you could. TalkThru is another feature, and what it does is the exact opposite of ANC. It lowers any audio you are playing, and lets sound come through as if you weren't even wearing the headphones! I thought it was freaky at first, as well, but it is very useful if you start a conversation, for example. Another feature these headphones have is Auto Play and Pause. This works so that if you take your headphones off, your music pauses, and if you put them back on, it plays! I find it very useful. Another mode for these headphones is Spatial Sound (or Spatial Audio, one of the two). This works so that you are further immersed in the music you are listening to, and I love it! It takes what I call a ""flat track"" and expands it so that you can almost hear each element of the music around you! Those were all of the features I felt would be helpful to know about, and the app is needed for most of these. The app also allows for more customization, as you can change the balance (left - right) and even customize the gestures (tapping on the side or button functions).BATTERY: 10.5 / 10: Incredible! The battery on these headphones is impressively long-lasting. I've never brought it down below 70%, and that says a lot because I will use it several times over the course of around two to three days while using ANC. It surprises me at how long it lasts, and it charges relatively quickly. On my old headphones, I always had to make sure it was charged, as it would die on me unexpectedly. When I use these JBL headphones, the battery isn't even something I need to consider when I use them. JBL has done an amazing job as far as this goes! I have nothing negative to say about it! : )Overall, these headphones are absolutely stunning! They are high quality, the design works well, the color pops (I have the blue ones), the sound is some of the best I have heard, the battery lasts forever, and the features are game-changers. I use these almost every day, and I use them when I mow, run, workout, weed-eat, and sometimes I even watch television and movies with them! That said, the app even lets you choose different modes of sound, which includes Music, Games, and Video, each with their respective modifications (for example, video mode improves video-audio synchronization). I've mentioned the app quite a bit so far, so I feel it is important to mention that yes, a LOT of the potential and functions these headphones have are accessed through the app, and that is really the biggest drawback I can think of. One other thing kind of bugs me, though sometimes I don't notice it. When you are running, for example, the headphones have a sort of rattle to them, and I don't like that very much. Over time I have gotten used to it, and it seems minor at this point, but I brought it up just in case. In addition, though this may just be the pair I received, every now and then (it is really inconsistent) I will hear some bad sound coming from one side of the headphones. It sounds kind of like static, but really sharp and only lasts for a fraction of a second. If I were to guess, I would say it is a loose wire or connection of some sort, but I really do not know. Again, I could only find that it is my case, and it doesn't even happen that often; only a few times out of the five months I've had it.So JBL has done it again! Impressive headphones with features and customization galore! These are the BEST. Did I mention they work even better and seamless with Google Devices? I would absolutely recommend these 110% to anyone looking for an immersive, high quality sound experience. A simplified PRO - CON list is below:PROS- Stunning Sound Clarity and Quality- A battery that lasts FOREVER- Unlimited Customization through the app- Multiple, impressive features that enhance the sound experience- Comfortable listening experience- Ease of use; simple touch controlsCONS- Most features require the app, as well as customization- Small rattle while running or during any abrupt movementRead more"

I wanted headphones that:Had high-quality wireless capability with mic support (48,000 Hz)Supported wired mode with mic functionalityHad decent battery life (needed to last a week)Finding headphones with good battery life was easy because models without flashy lights last a very long time. I can get over a week of battery on these, and I use them every day.The real challenge was finding high-quality wireless headphones. The problem is most Bluetooth headphones lower the sample rate when using the mic at the same time because there isn‚Äôt enough bandwidth. Sony and a few other companies have proprietary solutions for this, but at this price point, it's just not possible to get 48 kHz sample rate with the mic over Bluetooth.These headphones do face that same limitation when using the mic over Bluetooth (they're full quality when not using the mic), but they include a 2.4 GHz USB dongle that fixes everything and gives full-quality audio with mic support. Somehow, it also doesn‚Äôt pick up any interference, even though 2.4 GHz is a common frequency. You can also have it paired with 2 devices at once and double tap to switch devices. You cannot listen to both at once, but the Bluetooth device can take priority if its a phone receiving a call.As for wired mode, these headphones support it and yes, wired mode works even when the battery is dead. Most wireless headphones, like the Anker models, don‚Äôt include wired mode with mic support, so I can confidently say these meet all of my requirements.Almost a year later, they‚Äôre holding up fine. These are definitely large and not the most stylish, but if you care about performance and features, these are the headphones for you.Read more"

"Sennheiser MOMENTUM 4 Wireless Headphones - Bluetooth Headset for Crystal-Clear Calls with Adaptive Noise Cancellation, 60h Battery Life, Lightweight Folding Design, Black",$265.95,4.0 out of 5 stars,"7,609","5 stars to me. 4 stars all around for the average consumer due to issues I believe others will find a problem with but I have found some workarounds forI will start off with the flaws (unfortunately it has em) from my experience and some solutions. They are mostly features based. I'll also address confusions and ""negative"" experiences as there are reviews where clearly it's the people and not the headphones that are the problem yet they are giving this a worse impression that it should have. And lastly praise what it has going well for itAlso, I will highly suggest downloading the new app version called smart control PLUS and install any firmware updates. Then go adjust settings or it will have some annoyances.FlawsOn-head detection: this causes most of the headaches. For those that like to free up an ear to listen to someone talk better - make a habit of freeing your left ear and not the right. There is a sensor to detect your ear and it is only INSIDE the right earcup.  It makes a double click noise when it detects and stops detecting your ear. Unfortunately it makes a similar sound for both which is a huge flaw as you might not know if it is detecting or not sometimes. This will trigger the auto off feature if it doesn't detect you while you're listening to music. It usually pauses from the headset, but there is a possibility it can be ignored by an app and continue playing so when you put it back on you might not even know if it detected you. Another possibility is you made the mistake of pressing play from the app itself when it stops detecting you thus eventually triggering the sleep feature. You can disable auto off but I personally put it in 1 hour just in case as I would have likely readjusted my headset by that point and reset it. This goes into the next feature: auto play. It's perfectly fine on mobile but on PC it can be a nightmare as you could be listening to music, you adjust your right earcup so it pauses and when you put it back on, it might play some other video like youtube in an open browser; it depends on the programs that behave to bluetooth pause/play. So don't have so many open video/audio programs in the background. Also for those with long hair, autoplay can struggle to detect if it completely covers your right ear (some people start to think it stopped working). Overall, I just disabled autoplay while keeping auto-off enabled as I mainly use the M4 on PC, but again, it seems to work really well on mobile. Plus of course if any of these aren't necessary to you, you can simply disable it as a whole for an old fashioned headphone experience to avoid annoyances but I have gotten used to it at this point that I rarely have issues [Update: I just learned on May 2025 that as of the new firmware 2.13.42 it reads ""Improved auto-off behavior reducing unexpected behavior during calls or streaming due to misdetection in smart pause sensor"", so perhaps this section might become untrue with less flaws down the road thus hopefully improving user experience]Multi- point connection: It can and will connect to two devices that have bluetooth active after they have been paired. There are individuals that pair their headphones to everything and might experience a random connection. Unfortunately no disabling this so you have to be precise with what you want to connect this with. I only paired this to PC and mobile so it doesn't attempt to connect to anything else but in the app you can click to what else in the list want to connect to (or delete). When it detects multiple signals it will prioritize connecting to what you last used, it seems. Not an issue for me. Also, it will ALWAYS prioritize audio for the first connection of the two which will usually be the phone. This is important. If it connects to my phone first, well lets say Im on the PC listening to music, once your phone makes any kind of sound, your audio will switch to it and interrupt the music, then resume playing your PC's music. Because of this, disable useless sounds like the lock screen opening sounds because that will trigger a switch (not sure about typing sounds). I have sound on for notifications to get my attention for the phone but if that is an annoyance I would try connecting other devices (like PC) as your main device first and then phone second. That way, it will ONLY play audio on the main device (PC) in spite of your phone making noises or playing audio. I tend to disable phone bluetooth, so it isn't an issue for me what connects first anyways. Now, this is a major flaw which may have been addressed in the new firmware update and app but I have not fully tested yet so this is based on months old experience. Last flaw with this. Do not have constant audio playing on -BOTH- devices because it will cause some static to what you are listening to. No idea why this happens but sometimes the music sounds glitchy and I realize it's because my PC is playing music alongside my phone. All it takes is not having something like music playing on the second device and it gets clean.Reboot: it can be done on the power button after holding for over 15 seconds. Be careful NOT to do this if it is not your intention. I have a friend who accidentally did thisHigh resolution: app is glitched if you try to do personalized sound after enabling high resolution. It will ask you to disable high resolution before proceeding. All you have to do is go to standard mode, make your sound profile, then go back and enable High Resolution.Confusions:ANC: some people complain you can't turn off ANC. You sort of can. Old app, on the ANC slide, you put the slider in the middle. Most importantly, the new version of the app now allows to turn off ANC and might possibly increase your battery life. Oh, and some people remark of ANC randomly activating when outside. That is the wind noise reduction activating during air blowing directly to your mics. You can turn it off in ANC settings (you can also adjust transparency during phone calls there) but trust me that you don't want to hear wind transmitted into a headsetAuto-answer calls: complaints on this but another reason you need the app to disable it if you don't want it.Aut-connect: some complain that if it moves it will auto connect or cause confusion when they don't know why their bluetooth loud speakers stopped working until they realize the headphones are connected. I personally love auto connect and has never been an issue. I put my headphones away where it won't move at all and once I grab it, boom, just straightforward and smooth connection grab and go. This is a feature of auto off so if you don't want it to be doing this you can either disable auto off (more like sleep) or turn off the headphones directly from the power button (which means you will also have to turn it back on with the button). I don't think of it as a flaw to be honestDiscord/meeting calls: This is a big one. There are people mentioning how when they get on discord, their music and game sounds muffled. That is its hands free activating because it believes you are in a call. It prioritizes the call once it is activating its mic. You may have noticed it on your phone before too with music getting muffled. Problem is these then get compared directly to a gaming headset. Most gaming headsets have a usb dongle. Those dongles are designed to give both high quality low latency audio and mic signals at the same time. These? They are bluetooth headsets not specifically designed for gaming but rather for high quality audio. This is not a major fault of the headset. There exists a workaround for this but you will have to disable handsfree and rely on a different mic (which can be a far superior option anyways). To do this - on windows 11, go to settings. Click ""bluetooth & devices"". Then click on ""view more devices"" up top to go to a drop down list of devices. Scroll all the way down until you find ""more devices and printer settings"". Find the M4 headset, right click and go to properties. Click on the hardware tab. On this list, look for Name ""Momentum 4 Hands-Free"" that is under Type ""Sound, Video..."". Click once on it then click on properties below. In properties, General tab, click on the blue and yellow shield that says Change Settings. Then go to the Driver tab and Click Disable Driver. Reboot PC. Can be undone in similar method. At this point it has no headset mic active ~specifically~ on the PC (phone should be unaffected) so audio will be clear but now an external mic will be needed.Experiences:Connectivity: people say they have connectivity issues but thankfully it is very rare for me. It has a good distance to it too. I keep up to date with everything on my phoneTouchpad: some say it is very sensitive. It is certainly more sensitive than usual but there are exaggerations to it. My hair does not trigger it. Turning my head does not trigger it. I don't trigger it with a hoodie on. I don't wear beanies over it (why would you?) so I cant say anything there. Stretching my arms above my head might trigger and laying my head on the right side might make it think you want to change volume or transparency. But some of these reviews are funny. They are not rated to be water resistant at all (like most headsets) so if rain drops trigger it, actually no, WHY DO YOU EVEN HAVE IT IN THE RAIN?App: the app is fine minus the glitch [refer to High Resolution in Flaws] and has only been improving bit by bit. There's now also a new version which requires a new download that will likely be getting more of a focus onDurability: it is plastic which makes it lighter but thankfully I have not broken anything. I have bumped it into things, dropped it once. I try to treat is as glass so these are rare occurrences. I would not work out in these due to the fact they are not designed to deal with liquid. If problems occur because you work out in these, well that's your fault, but there exist rubber sweat covers to put over the padding to help out a bit. The Sennheisers Momentum 4/Sport earbuds I believe have water resistance and might be worth a look instead if you need a true gym companionStrengthsAudio quality: right out of the box, they are great. It has a neutral sound profile while having some attention to bass. There are presets in the app that are decent and it really does not need a bass booster but it exists. To be honest, I would skip everything and go straight for the sound personalization feature in the app. It's very simple to adjust, uses mostly sliders while you listen to audio. And once you are done it will create a setting that somehow manages to be far superior than what's already available in the app. It just cleans up the sound so much more to your liking; the difference is bewildering. Ever since that point, I have not listened to music the same. Just when I thought I was getting bored of music, these revived that love to want to listen to everything again and also motivated me to listen to things I never did before. There is literally pre-Sennheiser and during-Sennheiser eras to me now and am curious to their wired headsets. One thing that will become super noticeable is its soundstage. It spreads the instruments to a degree where you can notice more of everything. Albeit, this can be discombobulating and bassheads might not like the lack of sharp precision but this isn't meant to be your average linear listening experience (the Accentum Plus offers this at a much lower price). To give an example: What is Life by George Harrison. I might prefer it on the more linear style I am used to but these can separate things to the point where it is also directional and you can feel like you are standing at a concert and George is directly in the middle of it all in front of you so it feels more real- similar to as if you are becoming conscious of your own breathing. And in midst of all the chaos, you can still clearly hear George's voice and you notice ALL of the instruments more. It first gave me goosebumps how much it changed the song. Some songs are designed to be ""linear"" which could possibly affect emotional type of songs negatively but from a musical perspective, my goodness it is incredible. Now I just go back to see what music I am used to that changes with these (hint: a lot). Electronic/hip-hop music perhaps is the exception but this gives such clarity to detail that it is still a great listen- one thing is for sure these headsets love when there is a band setup (Bjork, the Roots, Gorillaz, etc). Sound quality is the biggest reason you go for these.Comfort: I can go on for a while without my ears hurting or anything. Also these don't heat up much and has proper adjustability for bigger headsLook: I have the black with copper ring and they are absolutely gorgeous. I question the longevity of the cloth on the headstrap but it makes it more beautiful than it has any business being for a plastic headsetFeatures: ANC is better than I expected. It does its job, and though it might not lead in this category, the differences are so small compared to the competition. Also drowned out what I needed it to during plane trips. And hearthrough, although I have had better, they will more than suffice to the point where I rarely have any issues hearing people. The fact that it is good at both of these is amazing for value.Battery: they can go up to nearly 60 hours, especially in standard mode. Not an exaggeration. I can go days without charging them. For this quality of headset, I don't think much of the competition comes close to this. In fact this is the mind blowing part because most other bluetooth headsets don't sound anywhere as good as these and they have half the battery life if not worse. No fears when travelling that it will die on me. In fact, it lasted me an entire week's tripSurprisesGaming: it has low enough latency. Combine that with that very clean audio and surprising directional audio this already has and wow, it performs quite well. I can actually spot details better and sometimes extra details I wasn't aware like I remember distinctly many months ago when I played Paladins, not only was I able to hear behind a wall slightly above me, but I realized it was subtle high heel sounds. I am not saying this will replace top of the line gaming headsets like steel series but if you have these and not a gaming headset, these will more than suffice.Charging: I was already enamored by the battery life but the fact is, it handles charging nearly as well. You can get hours worth per 10 minutes of charging and around an hour and a half or so it will be fully charged. That may not sound great but half of that will net you 30 hours of life which is STILL more than the competition. And the other surprise was that I accidentally discovered on the PC that you can still use it while charging - it simply appears as a different sound output you have to switch to. I thought it was weird how multiple momentum 4's appeared but when I clicked the other output, music started booming through it again. I was shocked. It already has a super long battery life with quick charging. It doesn't need it yet it has it. I have never had a headset that allows that with USB-C. Sennheiser were practically showing off at this point. So I would get a super long cable to make this comfortable during charging if you think this is a feature you will be usingThese are already the greatest -bluetooth- headsets I have ever owned under the $500 mark. I have tried out direct competitors Airpods Max (best hearthrough and good clean quality) and Sony Xm5's (amazing features and stylish) but the M4 felt like a no brainer. The max have poor battery life (under 20 hours) meanwhile these can reach close to triple that. The XM5's are light and so smooth with their features and touchpad (I loved speak to chat) but their fragility comes into question as they are notorious for the hinges breaking no matter how good you take care of them while the M4's mostly have earpads wearing down (easily replaceable). Meanwhile, guess what? The M4's imo sound better than both of them, are more comfortable than both, and can be found MUCH cheaper than both as I have seen it as low as $190. Even if, say, the Bowers & Wilkins PX8 might have slightly better audio and a better build, it's not a major difference so it is imo horrifically overpriced while this just has much higher value after sales and is an easier recommendationOverall, it absolutely bothers me just how overrated the other headsets on Amazon usually are meanwhile these get a bad impression. If you are a fan of music and you want to improve that experience with the bluetooth format at great affordability, it doesn't get better than theseRead more"
"Raycon Everyday Earbuds (2024 Edition) - Bluetooth True Wireless in-Ear Buds with 32 Hours Playtime, Multpoint Technology, Extreme Comfort, and Active Noise Cancellation (Blush Violet)",$55.99,4.2 out of 5 stars,"31,961","I've always wanted to buy these and glad I finally did.Fit is ideal and comfortable as the earphones don't sit on the ear but go into it to better deliver the sound and maximize noise cancellation and comfort especially during long use. Because of this I can wear these to sleep, work out, or in public or at work, without worrying they will fall out, especially while talking or moving my jaw while eating or laying down to sleep. I've worn these constantly since opening the box to give a true test run and I'm very satisfied with the ease of use and it's reliability and battery. Bass is exceptional but won't beat other brands that have 3 speakers with one solely dedicated to bass alone but that's ok, since you can't beat the value received for this price.The sound is excellent along all ranges, battery is something I don't even worry about as I've been able to use all day and at night while going to sleep, but most importantly they won't fall out or hurt my ears after long use. While working out or outside in the Texas heat sweating I've had no Issues. The case isn't overly huge so fits in my pockets comfortably which allows me to take anywhere I go all day easily instead of in a bag or setting down near me, which is how most people lose or forget more expensive brands to begin with. Touch controls make it easy to adjust, skip, or stop and start what I'm listening to. *Read the touch instructions and understand them instead of comparing to a different brand, each brand is different so expect that going in.Initially I ordered these simply as a short term replacement because I lost one of my beats while sleeping and didn't want to pay another 200 plus for a pair with ANC/transparency ability when I knew it was still there somewhere but didn't have time to find it lol Next day fast delivery and my problem was fixed for the time being.I constantly listen to music, podcasts and also use my earphones for calls all day so I always need a good pair to rely on and these have just become some of my favorites to use day and night, at work or home. So I'll be not only keeping these but ordering another pair as a gift because that is how good these are.Read more"
"Marshall Major IV On-Ear Bluetooth Headphone, Black",$64.99,4.6 out of 5 stars,"16,507","These are genuinely the best over ear headphones I've ever bought. I haven't wrote a review yet because I said to myself when I first got them, I'd write a review when they start to mess up or if I ever sent them back. Now's the time.I've had these for a little over 2 years now. They're still going strong.IN SHORT - Best overall headphones for heavy music enjoyers or everything else, the best battery life I've ever seen, best bass and clear tones, especially for how light weight and small they are. Very aesthetic and look good with any outfit. I love them so much and almost never take them off, my dad calls them my ears because of how much I wear them. Best investment, BUY THEM!!I listen to all types of music; rock, heavy metal, rap, hip-hop, r&b, pop, indie etc. etc.. these are overall amazing for every genre. Personally, they are the best for r&b and rock/metal.They have 10/10 bass for how small and light weight they are. Clear sound and not muffled, clear mid tones and the left to right sound is great. These things really pack some power. They can get really, really loud. I never turn the volume all the way up because when they are, they're nearly as loud as a phone speaker.Battery life is a 1298439/10. These last FOREVER. I wear them almost 8+ hours a day all through my school day. I have only ever had them die on me 5 times in the 2 years I've had them. I honestly think they can last over 80+ hours if you have the volume turned down. I charge them about once a week but, I could go almost 2 full weeks without needing a charge while on mid to high volume.Charging is easy. The 15 minute charge for 15 hours is a real thing and great for when I forget to charge them and need to run out the door in a time crunch. I can't harp on how amazing the battery life is though. They also have a wireless charge feature I've only used twice. I don't really know if it charges any faster or slower using one but it does work to some extent.SUPER STURDY. I drop these A LOT. I wear them while roller blading, skating and going to the gym and they've fallen off when I fall and dropped off my head. They've never broke in any physical way and have no real connection issues from it. I think there okay for gym or active use because of how much padding is around your ears so no moisture gets into the speaker or any of the sensitive parts.Controls are easy with the joystick. I actually wear mine backwards (I explain why further down) and found the controls to be easy to understand. The 'joystick' like control is really cool and I find better than touch control. You don't have to press too hard to change to the next or previous or control volume. I find on touch controlled headphones they get pressed accidently constantly, while this one has never changed anything out of its own accord.Also with controls is the light indicator. When charging: Red is nearly dead, Yellow is mid battery and Green is near fully charged or fully charged. When they are first turned on a sound plays to let you know and there is a flashing white light until paired. To put them in paring mode: hold down the power on position on the joystick until another sound plays and a flashing blue light comes on, then you can pair with Bluetooth. From there a solid white light stays on to show they are paired and on.A negative I have about these is the comfort. I have a mid sized head and ears and I found these uncomfortable for even 30 minutes wearing them the right way. (right side on right ear, left ear on left ear) So, I tried them on backwards and found that to be a better solution. I don't know how to explain it the best but they seem to be built at an angle that I assume was supposed to be formed to a normal head shape. I find it puts pressure on the back of my ears. I find it more comfortable to wear them backwards.  Only thing with that is the control joystick is backwards (left is next and right is the previous, up is volume down and down is volume up) but these were easy for me to get used to.Other than that I wear these 8+ hours almost everyday. Naturally with over ear headphones some ear fatigue will occur but with how committed I am to these it's never been a real bother.The only other downside I've ever had was that they've stalled on me. It's happened about 3 to 5 times in the 2 years I've had them, but I'll be playing a song, they'll freeze, make a really loud sound and cut off completely. I don't understand why this happens because I've just been using them like normal but after they cut off, I turn them back on and they pair and work like normal. It could be from dropping them or something similar but this didn't start until around a year and a half of constant use.To summarize again. Really really good value for money. I had been looking for over ear headphones for the longest and found a review on these and bought them on sale for $100 but I would pay full price for these any day. My dad is from the 70s and loves his extra loud, bassy music. He bought these and, while he opted for the Skullcandy Crushers, he said these had amazing bass for how small they are, they just weren't suited for his everyday work. Knowing him, If he complemented them on bass, you know these are actually amazing for rather normal people. These are great and I hope you give them a try.Thank you Marshall for the amazing quality and real joy these have brought me!Read more"

"Wireless Earbuds 75hrs Bluetooth 5.4 Headphone Sport, 2025 Bluetooth Earbuds Stereo Deep Bass Over Ear Bud with Earhooks, ENC Noise Cancelling Mic, IPX7 Waterproof Earphone, Royal Blue",$25.64,4.3 out of 5 stars,"16,597","i love these! i had a purple pair, but unfortunately, someone had stolen them recently. so, I bought a new pair being I liked them so much. they def don't fall out of my ears like other earbuds do. the bass and sound quality is wonderful. they're definitely loud, so if you're phone (or other devices you may use them with) is like mine and has nice bass already, you're in for a treat. I've had earbuds that made my head and brain feel like they were vibrating, I'm not a fan of that feeling really, so I love that these ones don't do that but have the great bass still. I love the fact that they have a button so that just a small tap won't pause or change anything when you don't want it to. even for phone calls, YouTube videos, and tiktok these are great! mine came in with a battery charge of 100% as well, so you should be able to use them right away. the purple pair that had gotten stolen had come in with a 97% charge, too. they do come with a charger but no USB block, which I don't feel like it's an issue. I'm sure we all have a block for that laying around or we could use a desktop or laptop to charge them. the color is very pretty, too! i was expecting more of a purple tone to it since I ordered purple blue this time, but they're more blue. still gorgeous! I'm definitely going to be ordering more, though. i want the light green ones, too! I love all the different color options! and they're all such pretty colors. the purple ones were so bright, I do miss those ones! but I adore these ones for sure! the little screens in the case have never never lagged for me, either. you'll see when the charge is decreasing and it does alert you when it's low immediately. the screen on the right does show what is pictured and will let you know if they're unevenly charged, which sometimes I only use one earbud, so that's great to know septhow much of a charge they have. they're definitely worth the price and I do recommend them! packaging is safe and secure for them as well! there is a film to pull off that protects the case when you unbox it as well. and they do come with a little bag of rubber ear pieces of different sizes, which is also awesome! i believe there's 2-3 different sized ones in the little bag. soooo 10/10 definitely recommend!Read more"

I wasn't thinking they would be this good but im impressed. I was thinking about going for the JBL's but they don't have the ear support and would have probably been falling out and all so i took a chance and i hit! I would totally. Recommended to anyone who wears these on the move or just wants comfort at a low price. My only problem is i went for the purple color and they are more pink looking in person. I kept getting asked why i got that color so i said they were on sale for breast cancer awareness month i gotta huge discount.üòÇüòÇüòÇRead more
